    "INTRODUCTION\n",
    "ACCORDING TO GALLUP'S State of the American Workplace report,\n",
    "only 30 percent of employees strongly agree that their opinions count\n",
    "at work.1 Yes, only 30 percent. So, what does that mean for the other\n",
    "70 percent? Well, they're likely feeling unheard, unseen, and not\n",
    "understood. Remember the last time someone didn't listen to\n",
    "something you felt was important? When they completely shot down\n",
    "your idea or just ignored it? I'm sure it felt pretty crappy—in all of its\n",
    "“Why am I even in this meeting?” glory.\n",
    "But why is this the case? What's causing this feeling among so\n",
    "many employees throughout the workplace?\n",
    "First let's look at how different today's modern workforce really is.\n",
    "Right now, five generations are out there working together, ranging in\n",
    "age from 16 to over 75. And within these generations, more and more\n",
    "diversity has entered the mix. No matter whether you are looking at\n",
    "gender, race, ethnicity, or religion, the workplace doesn't look like it\n",
    "did 50 years ago (or even 10 or 20).\n",
    "And then mixed in with those differences in age, culture, and\n",
    "whatever else, we have all sorts of different personalities! Who we are\n",
    "and how we think is made up of all of the experiences we've had in\n",
    "our lives up until this point. Each individual brings their own way of\n",
    "seeing things and expressing them into their careers (and around that\n",
    "conference room table). No two people—even if they share similar\n",
    "backgrounds or demographics—have the same perspective.\n",
    "OK, so after reviewing all of this, it's pretty clear that we have\n",
    "many differences cropping up in the workplace. And it's pretty safe to\n",
    "say that these contribute to why so many employees are having\n",
    "trouble getting through to their colleagues and bosses. So, what do we\n",
    "do about it?\n",
    "The first step is to recognize that these differences exist, and that\n",
    "they're here to stay. We need to respect and embrace our varied\n",
    "viewpoints, and then we can start to communicate across (not against)\n",
    "them. We need to accept these differences as a natural part of working\n",
    "with others and we need to start actually listening to each other. Open\n",
    "your ears to what others have to say. Open your mind to different\n",
    "ideas and ways of thinking. Agree that you're likely to always disagree\n",
    "on some things. But make it a point to at least start talking about what\n",
    "these things are.\n",
    "This book provides hands-on tools to help you start and guide\n",
    "these important conversations. It covers mediums and phrases to use.\n",
    "Strategies to enact. Physical spaces to build and transform. It explains\n",
    "\n",
    "how taking a novel approach—for something big, or something small\n",
    "—can ultimately create the opportunity for new dialogue that gets you\n",
    "moving forward.\n",
    "We'll talk about how we can break down communication barriers\n",
    "in our modern work environments and how this is just as important in\n",
    "our digital spaces as it is in person (or maybe even more so). We'll\n",
    "cover important questions: How do we connect with our virtual\n",
    "coworkers via technology? How do we navigate change as leaders and\n",
    "as employees? When should we take a conversation out of an email,\n",
    "and into someone's office?\n",
    "Other chapters talk about how we can make ourselves accessible\n",
    "to build relationships; why it's important to be transparent and always\n",
    "put all of our cards on the table; and how to say no while still\n",
    "fostering a culture of openness and creativity. We'll get into tackling\n",
    "challenges like departmental divides, the silo effect, and toxic\n",
    "coworkers.\n",
    "And we'll also talk about some crucial—and sometimes hard-to-\n",
    "have—discussions that need to start happening. How do we openly\n",
    "talk about diversity, inclusion, and belonging? How do we get out of\n",
    "our comfort zones and start genuinely trying to understand where\n",
    "people are coming from? How do we make our workplaces more . . .\n",
    "human?\n",
    "Ultimately, I hope you use the tools in this book to develop\n",
    "stronger teams that are built on trust and authentic communication.\n",
    "This doesn't mean everyone will be best friends or high-fiving across\n",
    "cubicles. But it will mean respect, clarity, and directness—all made\n",
    "possible with more productive communication.\n",
    "The majority of the advice in this book applies to both managers\n",
    "and non-managers and can be used by employees at all levels of an\n",
    "organization. If you are a manager, use your influence to implement\n",
    "these strategies and make your teams better. If you're not a manager\n",
    "and read about an idea that would make sense in your organization,\n",
    "bring it up to your supervisor. Let's not think in terms of us versus\n",
    "them. We're all in this together.\n",
    "Remember, though, there are no quick fixes. Working toward\n",
    "change takes time. It takes conscious effort. This book is a good start\n",
    "for getting everyone on the same page, or at least in the same room,\n",
    "but I would be doing you a disservice if I said it answers any and all\n",
    "questions about working in diverse workplaces. People and\n",
    "environments are constantly changing and evolving, and each\n",
    "individual coworker or supervisor is always a person all their own.\n",
    "You should mold and adapt the strategies you find in the pages that\n",
    "follow, including the “Human Connections” I've included from other\n",
    "content experts, to your own particular situations and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "But also remember this: Every employee within an organization\n",
    "can provide value. Every. Single. One. Everyone is in a position of\n",
    "power to bring change to their role, to their unit, and to the overall\n",
    "success of an organization. What makes you different is what makes\n",
    "you great. So, learn to appreciate these differences in your colleagues,\n",
    "and understand how these things might impact how they think, act, or\n",
    "feel in the workplace. Doing so might be hard or uncomfortable, but\n",
    "invest in getting there. One conversation at a time.\n",

    "CHAPTER 1\n",
    "Putting Our Strengths into Action\n",
    "THE BEST EMPLOYEES bring something to the table that no one\n",
    "else can. But sometimes these talents and strengths are overlooked,\n",
    "underutilized, or even mistaken for weaknesses. When we don't know\n",
    "each other's strengths, we're not maximizing the effectiveness of the\n",
    "conversations we can have, and we're not making efficient use of our\n",
    "talent resources. Taking the time to uncover each of our strengths\n",
    "helps us understand why people communicate in certain ways and\n",
    "what information they need to make decisions. Doing so also provides\n",
    "us with insight into how we can adjust our own communication styles\n",
    "to be more effective, and it helps us get to the bottom of why we seem\n",
    "to butt heads with certain people, while having better synergy with\n",
    "others.\n",
    "While at work, have you ever encountered these scenarios?\n",
    "• Have you been a part of a brainstorm session where a few people seem\n",
    "to have all the ideas while others silently listen?\n",
    "• Have you had a supervisor who constantly looks for more data and\n",
    "facts before making a decision on beginning a new project, while you\n",
    "have been ready to start the project since before you even talked to\n",
    "your supervisor?\n",
    "• Have you had a colleague who stops meetings and goes around the\n",
    "room to see if anyone else has anything to say, which adds another 20\n",
    "minutes to your already long meeting?\n",
    "• Have you had a peer who's always 10 steps ahead of everyone else\n",
    "while thinking through a project, while you're just trying to focus on\n",
    "what needs to be done by the end of the day?\n",
    "These are just a few examples of diverse strengths being applied\n",
    "in the workplace. We all think and act differently, and although\n",
    "certain actions may be frustrating to you, they are not necessarily bad.\n",
    "This is how others utilize their strengths to benefit their work, and\n",
    "they should not be thought of as right or wrong. In fact, the way you\n",
    "conduct yourself in meetings at work may be just as frustrating to\n",
    "others. If you don't know where someone is coming from, or why they\n",
    "\n",
    "complete tasks the way they do, it can be infuriating.\n",
    "For instance, the people who are silent in your brainstorm session\n",
    "might be deliberating about what to say and how to say it. They might\n",
    "not talk a lot, but when they do, it is logical, well thought out, and can\n",
    "be something no one else has thought of before.\n",
    "And that supervisor who always wants data to support their\n",
    "decisions? It might appear to you as if they're holding you back from\n",
    "moving forward, but they're likely working through potential pitfalls\n",
    "and managing risk for the success of the project. They're concerned\n",
    "about doing things right (and thoroughly) the first time.\n",
    "The annoying colleague who spends extra time going around the\n",
    "room to get feedback is making sure everyone's opinion is heard.\n",
    "Doing so might make the meeting go longer (eye rolls inserted here),\n",
    "but what they really want is to ensure that the group is not missing\n",
    "any details and that all attendees feel valued and are given the chance\n",
    "to share their insight.\n",
    "And your peer who is already 10 steps ahead? What they're really\n",
    "doing is thinking about the future and what the project will look like\n",
    "as a whole. It's important to them to be inspired by thinking about\n",
    "what could be and how what you're working on right now will\n",
    "positively impact the big picture.\n",
    "HUMAN CONNECTION\n",
    "I was working with a team to put together a self- and\n",
    "management assessment. There was an employee from IT, a project\n",
    "manager, and two representatives from human resources (including\n",
    "myself) on our team. I wanted to ensure that people's strengths were\n",
    "coming out and that I was using them correctly. We all had previously\n",
    "taken the CliftonStrengths assessment to identify our top five talents.\n",
    "During the process, the project manager was always looking for\n",
    "background information. She would ask questions about what had\n",
    "been done in the past that led us to this point to make a change. She\n",
    "wanted to understand the history so she could make better decisions\n",
    "moving forward. She was utilizing her strength of Context.\n",
    "My colleague in human resources wanted deadlines and\n",
    "deliverables throughout the process to ensure he knew what he was\n",
    "responsible for and to keep others on track, which was his strength of\n",
    "Responsibility. The IT staff member used his Futuristic strength and\n",
    "asked a lot of questions to get a better understanding of the project.\n",
    "He wanted to look past the utilization of the tool to see how we would\n",
    "implement the assessment in our performance conversations. He also\n",
    "wanted to know what reports would need to be generated and how\n",
    "leaders and managers would be using that data. These pertinent\n",
    "questions helped him design the form in a way that would allow us to\n",
    "filter reports to meet our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was really interesting because we were all attacking\n",
    "the same problem, but from different perspectives. Once we\n",
    "understood each other's strengths and why we were either asking\n",
    "questions, wanting deadlines, or needing context, it made it easier for\n",
    "us to work together. We achieved a better result because we knew\n",
    "where we were all coming from.\n",
    "HEATHER Z. KAY, Gallup Certified Strengths Coach\n",
    "Identifying Strengths\n",
    "When we inspect the preceding scenarios with this lens, we can\n",
    "see how our employees, coworkers, and supervisors used their\n",
    "strengths to enhance the team. But when we're living through such\n",
    "instances, it feels like the people we work with are going out of their\n",
    "way to make our job harder. In reality, they're applying their strengths\n",
    "to work through things in their own way.\n",
    "A strength is something that comes naturally to us and gives us the\n",
    "highest confidence in the outcome we produce. We all have strengths.\n",
    "Even if you don't realize it, you are subconsciously acting in certain\n",
    "ways because of them. And although it's great that we all have them,\n",
    "how can we proactively identify them for ourselves and others? How\n",
    "can identifying these strengths give us perspective on how we apply\n",
    "them? Likewise, how can we use them to better understand our\n",
    "colleagues? Here are some suggestions:\n",
    "Look inward. It can be hard to look internally, identify what makes\n",
    "you unique, and see what you bring to the table. Move beyond the\n",
    "basic, “What are my strengths?” and ask yourself specific questions:\n",
    "[image] During which tasks do I lose track of time?\n",
    "[image] What am I working on right now that I'm excited about?\n",
    "[image] What is an accomplishment I'm proud of and why?\n",
    "Ask directly. When you're trying to identify your teammates' or\n",
    "employees' strengths, reframe the questions above and ask them\n",
    "directly:\n",
    "[image] “What do your coworkers rely on you most for?”\n",
    "[image] “During which tasks do you lose track of time?”\n",
    "[image] “What are you working on right now that you're excited\n",
    "about?”\n",
    "[image] “What is an accomplishment you're proud of and why?”\n",
    "Ask others. Another way to gain perspective on your coworkers'\n",
    "strengths is to ask people who work with them on a consistent and\n",
    "ongoing basis. It can be the colleague that sits next to them or an\n",
    "employee in another department who uses them as a resource.\n",
    "[image] “What type of work do they tend to ask to do?”\n",
    "[image] “What energizes them?”\n",
    "\n",
    "[image] “What tasks make them light up?”\n",
    "[image] “When do they seem most engaged?”\n",
    "Observe. Take time to observe others' strengths in action. It's not\n",
    "necessarily about what they're doing, but how they're doing it. Two\n",
    "people can accomplish the same task, but they might go about it in\n",
    "different ways. Whereas one person might gather data to make a\n",
    "decision, another may speak to colleagues and gather previous\n",
    "experiences. Look at how they're successfully accomplishing their\n",
    "tasks. Don't turn this into a National Geographic research assignment,\n",
    "but do it casually to observe your coworkers acting naturally.\n",
    "Take an assessment, psychometric assessment, or inventory. Several\n",
    "assessments help us identify how and why we work the way we do.\n",
    "Some of the more popular ones are CliftonStrengths (Gallup),\n",

    "Navigating the Multigenerational\n",
    "Workforce\n",
    "WHEN WE TALK about generations, we're not just talking about a\n",
    "standard set of birth years. Generations are defined by technology,\n",
    "pivotal events, sociological trends, and economics during our\n",
    "formative years. These areas shape the way we think about the world\n",
    "around us and guide our interactions with others.\n",
    "But what happens when we work with people from other\n",
    "generations and don't understand where they're coming from? What do\n",
    "we do when someone is stuck in their own generational work style?\n",
    "• We start perpetuating stereotypes about a generation.\n",
    "• We link differences to lack of competence and work ethic.\n",
    "• We avoid others because we don't know the best medium in which to\n",
    "communicate.\n",
    "• We provide old incentives that no longer motivate or inspire.\n",

    "in our ways.\n",
    "Even in what seem to be the best workplace environments,\n",
    "communication breakdowns are bound to happen with varying\n",
    "personalities and age groups. If we don't try to understand the\n",
    "situations and experiences that make us who we are, we'll be stuck in\n",
    "a breakdown loop. The first step to moving forward is to have\n",
    "conversations across generations and get to know the people we work\n",
    "with.\n",
    "One of the exercises I do when facilitating workplace trainings is\n",
    "to have participants create a timeline of major national events that\n",
    "happened during their childhood. Examples of these include 9/11, the\n",
    "2008 recession, the Great Depression, legalization of gay marriage, the\n",
    "rise of social media and computers, and civil rights activism. Each\n",
    "participant then shares how this event has impacted their life, their\n",

    "motivators. Remember, this doesn't apply to every person in each\n",
    "generation, but it does give you a better idea of where they might be\n",
    "coming from.\n",
    "Traditionalists\n",
    "Traditionalists were born between 1925 and 1946. Many were\n",
    "raised during the Great Depression and value their jobs. Many have\n",
    "also worked for one company over the lifetime of their career, are\n",
    "extremely loyal, and get along well with their colleagues.\n",
    "In the workplace, a Traditionalist might be known as the\n",
    "figurehead of an organization. This rings true especially with family-\n",

    "Although many Traditionalists are retired, some are also being asked\n",
    "to come back on a consulting basis to help the newer generations\n",

    "classrooms. This helped them develop a sense of comradery and\n",
    "competition.2 Although Boomers may not have grown up with\n",
    "computers, it's important to not underestimate their interest and\n",
    "knowledge in the newest technology. They have been building in-\n",
    "person relationships for as long as they can remember, so if there is a\n",
    "barrier between them and the person they are trying to interact with,\n",
    "it can be a turn-off. Boomers also have a lot of crucial institutional\n",

    "how to say it is the next big step.\n",
    "One of the first things to think about is whether or not you want\n",

    "determine this is to think about whether the interaction will get in the\n",
    "way of your ability to work with the other person.\n",
    "If you believe it will, it's important to consider having this\n",
    "conversation, no matter how difficult it might be to start. For issues\n",
    "like sexual harassment or blatant racism, consider contacting your\n",
    "supervisor or HR. If you believe it's a misunderstanding, however, and\n",
    "that having this conversation can diffuse the situation, try these steps:\n",
    "Take some time to process. Before engaging in a conversation, take\n",
    "a moment to breathe and process the situation. It's not always best to\n",
    "immediately address an issue. Whether it's for a few minutes or a full\n",
    "day, be sure to give yourself some time before moving forward.\n",
    "If you have someone you trust, like a mentor, consider reaching\n",
    "out to them to process the issue, too, but make sure the conversation\n",
    "stays between the two of you. Being able to externally evaluate the\n",
    "situation with someone else will keep you level-headed and might help\n",
    "provide a structure for your dialogue. Running this by someone else is\n",
    "also a great baby step to gaining the courage to have the actual\n",
    "conversation. You can even write out talking points and areas you\n",
    "want to address and rehearse them in front of the mirror.\n",
    "Assume the best intentions. Assume the other person meant no harm\n",
    "by what they said or did and that they were unaware of the impact of\n",
    "their words or actions. If this is the case, bringing this up with them is\n",
    "a great opportunity to make them cognizant of a bias they're\n",
    "completely unaware they have. Helping them be aware of this could\n",
    "benefit their future interactions with others. Also, when we assume\n",
    "everyone has the best intentions, these conversations are easier to\n",
    "have. “I assume you did not mean to be hurtful in any way, but I want\n",
    "to bring to your attention that I was offended by your comments.”\n",
    "Provide a neutral location. Finding a neutral space where you and\n",
    "your coworker are both comfortable will make a big difference.\n",
    "This could be a local coffee shop, a huddle room, or a work café,\n",
    "as opposed to your office.\n",

    "relationship. “Thank you for taking the time to speak with me.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Show empathy. We all come from different backgrounds and life\n",
    "experiences, and that impacts the way we see the world and the\n",
    "people around us. Take a step back from what you think you know\n",
    "and try to understand the situation from the other person's\n",
    "perspective.\n",
    "Understand word choices. Avoid accusatory language that suggests\n",

    "what you are talking about. Lay out the facts first. “At our meeting this\n",

    "Down Silos\n",
    "ONE OF THE BIGGEST SILOS in an organization is in job\n",
    "functional areas. These silos are the spaces where all the members of a\n",
    "team are doing the same type of work, and as a result, they sometimes\n",
    "forget that other teams exist. Often, in larger companies, employees\n",
    "from one team don't interact with employees from another unless they\n",
    "need something. For example, a team might keep to itself except when\n",
    "there's an ask involved (like project funding, additional staff, or\n",
    "technology support).\n",
    "These silos become even more distinct when a company is spread\n",
    "out on different floors or different sections of a building or when a\n",
    "portion of the company works remotely. In such cases, people don't\n",
    "have as much of a chance of running into each other in the halls or at\n",
    "the printer. As a result, when a task needs input from other\n",
    "departments, employees in silos find themselves not knowing how or\n",
    "who to ask to move forward. A team existing in a silo may have no\n",
    "idea of the time or effort required for a process being done by another\n",
    "team. Some employees might not even know that there are resources\n",
    "or people available to help them outside of their silo—resulting in\n",
    "wasted time and repeated efforts. In addition, these silos can lead to\n",
    "turf wars because employees don't know what other departments are\n",
    "working on and find themselves battling for who should own a project\n",
    "or have access to resources.\n",
    "Like many societies, businesses tend to be siloed and segmented.\n",
    "This feeds our human need for structure and order. However, if we\n",
    "can't communicate with individuals in the next department over, what\n",
    "are we missing out on? What vital information are we missing that\n",
    "could help us stand out as leaders, employees, and an organization?\n",
    "Let's say you work in sales for a company that designs and\n",
    "manufactures equipment. How often are you talking to the people who\n",
    "—you know—actually manufacture the equipment? The ones who\n",

    "This type of disconnect is happening across industries, whether\n",

    "aren't just happening by department.\n",
    "The Silo Effect\n",
    "During the interview process for a role in higher education, I was\n",
    "given the opportunity to meet with several teams to identify if I would\n",
    "be a good fit for the organization. They each shared the exciting\n",
    "projects and events they were working on and what was coming down\n",
    "the pike. I noticed that a few of the events they were mentioning were\n",
    "similar in purpose and were taking place on the same day and time.\n",
    "They were essentially competing with one another to get the same\n",
    "students at separate events. It became clear to me that not only did the\n",
    "departments not work together to meet their organization's larger\n",
    "goals, but they were also unaware that they were duplicating efforts.\n",
    "After noticing the ongoing overlap in these conversations, I\n",
    "started to ask questions about working across departments. “Can you\n",
    "share examples of when various departments worked together to\n",
    "achieve a goal?” “What is your biggest challenge working in a siloed\n",
    "organization?” “How do you identify what department is tasked with a\n",
    "specific part or entirety of a project?” “How often do your departments\n",
    "get together to discuss what you're working on and how you can\n",
    "support one another?” I never thought I would see such confused faces\n",
    "after what I thought were simple questions about working together.\n",
    "While listening to their answers, I was imagining money being\n",
    "wasted, employee workloads overextending, and a turf war about to\n",
    "explode. If I was hired, I knew one of my biggest goals was going to be\n",
    "to try to open the lines of communication within the organization. For\n",
    "this organization to survive and thrive, they had to work together.\n",
    "After I was offered and accepted the job, I took a step back to identify\n",
    "the landscape before making any of the moves that we talk about in\n",
    "this chapter. In a new job, it's important to give it some time and lots\n",
    "of thought rather than coming in hot with a big list of changes.\n",
    "If you also find yourself spotting a lack of communication across\n",
    "departments or teams during an interview, take that into consideration\n",
    "when deciding whether it's an organization you want to work for.\n",
    "Although bringing people together is something I enjoy doing, I\n",
    "recognize it's not everyone's cup of tea. It can be hard work and\n",
    "requires a nuanced approach. Take note if this is a red flag for you and\n",
    "\n",
    "make your decisions accordingly.\n",
    "I believe that every department in an organization needs the\n",
    "others to function, whether the organization realizes it or not. Creating\n",
    "strategic partnerships and shared space for ongoing conversations is\n",
    "essential. However, the time to start these conversations isn't after a\n",
    "situation happens or a problem arises. Start talking before such a\n",
    "situation even starts. Being proactive helps build trust and a culture of\n",
    "service, and it shifts the dialogue from “we need you to do something\n",
    "for us” to “how can we work together for the best interest of the\n",
    "organization?” It also enhances collaboration while decreasing\n",
    "duplicate efforts.\n",
    "HUMAN CONNECTION\n",
    "Our human services nonprofit was very siloed, and as part of our\n",
    "effort, we created opportunities for cross-collaboration. We established\n",
    "a training steering committee and development, delivery, and learning\n",
    "management system subgroups. These groups have representation\n",
    "from all departments and meet monthly or quarterly. They discuss all\n",
    "training issues and initiatives being developed to see if they can be\n",

    "These efforts have made a huge difference for our organization. As\n",
    "opposed to creating a policy, training, or initiative for only one\n",

    "entire organization. This way of organizing our business also gives a\n",
    "voice to our frontline employees so they can share their ideas with\n",

    "DREW ALBERT, Manager of Culture and Development\n",
    "Collaboration: Move Past the Buzzword\n",
    "Collaboration is a word that gets thrown around a lot, and in some\n",
    "cases, it has lost its meaning due to overuse. We assume that if we tell\n",
    "our supervisors we're collaborating or share with our employees that\n",
    "collaboration is important, that we're on the same page on what it\n",
    "actually means. In some organizations, even saying the words let's\n",
    "collaborate leads to eyes rolling across the room. For some employees,\n",
    "this just sounds like, “Here's more work.”\n",
    "So, let's start off by talking about what collaboration is, and more\n",
    "importantly, what it isn't. You'll most likely see this word in one form\n",
    "or another in your company's mission statement. It may also show up\n",
    "as teamwork or partnership. In its essence, business collaboration means\n",
    "working with others to produce something. It's a two-way street where\n",
    "all parties involved are sharing knowledge and actively participating\n",
    "\n",
    "in the mutually beneficial relationship. Collaboration isn't when one\n",
    "side does all the work and you both take credit, or when you just\n",
    "simply share information or push work onto someone else. True\n",
    "collaboration is when both parties are invested and working together.\n",
    "But this is not something that can just happen on its own or in a\n",
    "vacuum. It requires an understood company culture, a defined system,\n",
    "and the appropriate resources and tools that encourage employees to\n",
    "work together across departments. When collaboration works, it not\n",
    "only helps the company's bottom line, but it also enhances morale,\n",
    "development among the staff, and communication across functional\n",
    "teams.\n",
    "Although some of the areas we'll talk about in this chapter fall\n",
    "under collaboration, it's important not to use this as an umbrella term\n",
    "any time people have a conversation across departments. When we\n",
    "generalize it, that's when we lose the essence, or worse, it starts\n",
    "getting used as a guise for passing the buck. “Wow, I'm really not into\n",

    "Instead, we're going to focus on how to open the lines of\n",

    "snail's pace try, “Can I get everyone's opinion on this?” “Does anyone\n",
    "have anything they would like to add?” Or try bringing similar\n",

    "of silence to let your team think over a question before you move on\n",

    "Know your audience. It's important to know who you're in a\n",
    "meeting with and to adapt how you run it based on the personalities\n",

    "• Find a place that's free of background noise and outside distractions.\n",
    "(Put your dog outside and maybe let the kids watch You-Tube in\n",
    "another room.)\n",
    "• Use headphones.\n",
    "• Turn on your unavailable status.\n",
    "• Turn off sound notifications.\n",
    "• Avoid distractions. Act like you're in the room with everyone else and\n",
    "put away your phone, turn off your TV, and don't work on another\n",
    "project.\n",
    "• Speak clearly (and remember to turn off your mute button before\n",
    "speaking).\n",
    "• Use visual aids, if possible.\n",
    "If you're on video, look into the camera as much as possible when\n",
    "speaking and listening.\n",
    "If you're finding yourself zoning out during virtual meetings, try\n",
    "these hacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Put a sticky note or photo under the camera so you remember to focus\n",
    "there.\n",
    "• Close all other windows on your computer.\n",
    "• Remove all other devices from your desk.\n",
    "• Physically stand up when you're speaking.\n",
    "You also want to consider the timing of meetings, especially if\n",
    "you're working across time zones. Try having your weekly meetings at\n",
    "the same time for one quarter, then rotating them to a different time\n",
    "for the next. You want to ensure that employees in one time zone\n",
    "aren't stuck always waking up early or staying up late to catch a\n",
    "meeting during nine-to-five hours in another part of the world.\n",
    "Create Opportunities for More\n",
    "Engagement\n",
    "With web conferencing, discussion, and messaging boards, we\n",
    "have so many options for starting and continuing conversations. The\n",
    "key is to find new and innovative ways to keep people engaged. When\n",
    "conducting meetings, try\n",
    "Setting up breakout rooms. These virtual rooms allow for small\n",
    "group discussion within the larger meeting. The groups can meet for a\n",
    "period of time to discuss a topic and then report back to the larger\n",
    "group.\n",
    "Allowing people to share their screen. When someone is sharing\n",
    "information, allow them to display their screen so everyone can follow\n",
    "along. This gives them ownership of material while allowing people to\n",
    "further understand what they're sharing.\n",
    "Creating a virtual note-taking space. Designate someone to take\n",
    "notes during the meeting and have them visible. Without nonverbal\n",
    "cues and with the potential for technology glitches, you want to make\n",
    "sure everyone is hearing the same information so they can ask\n",
    "questions and chime in with ideas in real time.\n",
    "HUMAN CONNECTION\n",
    "To increase participation on web conferencing platforms, I've\n",
    "kicked off sessions with a poll. This immediately captures engagement\n",
    "and then you can reflect on responses during the meeting. It helps\n",
    "people stay engaged and included in the guided discussion.\n",
    "You can also use these platforms to mimic real life. Discussion\n",
    "boards are a great way to engage on specific topics and often lead to\n",
    "spin off conversations. Using the “@” functionality to call on a person\n",

    "• If there's a central office where a few people you work with are\n",
    "\n",
    "stationed, ask for permission to travel once a quarter to have an in-\n",
    "person meeting.\n",
    "• Attend a professional development workshop, conference, training, or\n",
    "seminar close to corporate headquarters and work a day from that\n",
    "office.\n",
    "• Host an in-person team retreat at a neutral location so all members can\n",
    "meet one another.\n",
    "• Schedule your annual or quarterly review sessions in a central location\n",
    "or travel to your employees' headquarters.\n",
    "• If you're traveling and will be close to where one of your teammates or\n",
    "employees lives, ask to grab lunch.\n",
    "By making yourself available in person, you can get a real-time\n",
    "pulse on engagement and satisfaction. It's hard to see how people\n",
    "interact with each other in a virtual space, but in person, you can see\n",
    "who sits with whom, who seems disengaged, who is staring in space,\n",
    "and where the action is happening. Are people hanging out in the\n",
    "break room and saying hi to each other when they pass in the halls?\n",
    "Or is everyone's door shut, and theirs heads are down, focused on their\n",
    "computers? These are things you won't find on any fancy platform.\n",
    "And as an employee, spending in-person time with your boss can\n",
    "ensure they don't forget about you! Getting some quality face time\n",
    "with your supervisor can help you get a better gauge on your\n",
    "performance, areas for improvement, and future with the company.\n",
    "You Are Your Word\n",
    "Do what you say you're going to do! Maybe this goes without\n",
    "saying, but your word is important, especially on a virtual team. It's\n",
    "essential to follow through on your commitments, be on time to\n",
    "meetings, and keep others in the loop on what you're working on.\n",
    "Unlike working in an office, you can't stop a coworker in the hallway\n",
    "or pull them aside while they're heating up their lunch to check on the\n",

    "\n",
    "opportunities to enhance relationships and connections among your\n",

    "• “I'm not sure if my email ever made it to you as I haven't heard back”\n",
    "• “It appears you forgot to . . .”\n",
    "And here are some pretty bad ones when you think the other\n",
    "person should already know the answer to the questions they're\n",
    "asking:\n",
    "• “Per our last email” (The mother of all email snark!)\n",
    "• “Per our conversation”\n",
    "• “As discussed”\n",
    "• “As previously stated”\n",

    "• “According to my records”\n",
    "• “Please note”\n",
    "But why are they bad, and why should we stop using them?\n",
    "Because these phrases can often come across as accusatory, and you\n",
    "can almost see your mom waving her finger back and forth as you\n",
    "read them. They set a poor tone for the email and can immediately\n",
    "turn off your recipient. They are also unnecessary add-ons that serve\n",

    "Emotion can be hard to get across in an email, but the follow-up\n",

    "unmotivated to respond. And yes, of course intentionally not\n",

    "Mixing Up Meetings and the Power\n",
    "of New Spaces\n",
    "THE WAY WE WORK is constantly evolving, and a one-size-fits-all\n",
    "physical space doesn't provide us with what we need for the different\n",
    "elements of our roles. Think of a “typical” office with four walls, a\n",
    "stationary desk, a few drawers, two chairs, a computer, some office\n",
    "supplies, and a shared printer that only seems to work from 1:30 p.m.\n",
    "until 1:37 p.m. How can this space inspire creativity while allowing\n",
    "you to have one-on-one conversations, conduct larger meetings, and\n",
    "visualize the flow of the next big project or idea? It can't! We all need\n",
    "different spaces to get the creativity juices flowing and to interact with\n",
    "our colleagues, supervisors, and outside constituents.\n",
    "Many companies and organizations are changing their structural\n",
    "design to provide these spaces in which their employees engage in\n",
    "conversations, host and hold meetings more effectively, and enhance\n",
    "collaboration and innovation. These tweaks have helped build\n",
    "relationships and communication and enhance productivity.\n",
    "All organizations have some form of a hierarchy. But we don't\n",
    "have to make them so visually obvious. There are plenty of\n",
    "opportunities to shake things up and give power to people who\n",
    "sometimes feel like they're at the bottom of the food chain. These\n",
    "changes don't have to be earth shattering. They can be simple, and\n",
    "they can happen without big spending by the company.\n",
    "For example, plenty of times I have been sitting directly across\n",
    "from my boss in their “power chair,” trying to engage, and I just\n",
    "haven't felt like I had the power to do so. And it wasn't because they\n",
    "weren't giving me the floor to ask and answer questions or to provide\n",
    "additional feedback, but because there was this wall (the desk) in front\n",
    "of us. The large executive desk felt like a force field that I couldn't\n",
    "cross over. They could lean back in their comfy leather chair or spin\n",
    "around in circles if they wanted, whereas I was on the other side in a\n",
    "semi-uncomfortable nonmoving chair, which made it feel like I was\n",
    "about a mile away. This is a classic workspace problem that doesn't\n",
    "need to be fixed with a full-blown renovation.\n",
    "Although tearing down walls and making big changes may be in\n",
    "\n",
    "the cards for some organizations, others may not have such deep\n",
    "pockets. So, in this chapter, we're going to review both big and small\n",
    "adjustments we can make to our existing spaces, as well as\n",
    "conversations we can have if we're in the market to shake things up\n",
    "entirely. Even minor adjustments to our working spaces give us all the\n",
    "power to drive changes in communication.\n",
    "Before taking a deep dive into a major reconstruction project, let's\n",
    "start with the basics. These basic changes can come from any member\n",
    "of your organization and don't require a lot of money (if any). These\n",
    "are adjustments that you can implement immediately, and they will\n",
    "have an instant positive impact on the conversations you have with\n",
    "others in your company.\n",
    "Stand Up\n",
    "Sitting through an hour-long meeting can be torturous. Similarly,\n",
    "having to wait days for a weekly meeting when something needs to be\n",
    "addressed immediately can be the worst. One of my supervisors\n",
    "handled both of these problems by instituting 15-minute standing\n",
    "meetings during a busy season. We would all gather in his office at the\n",
    "start of the day and chat quickly about what was on the docket, the\n",
    "issues we were facing, and what support we needed. In these meetings,\n",
    "we were open to helping one another and making fast decisions, and\n",
    "we weren't stuck waiting a week to resolve timely issues. Keep in mind\n",
    "that standing meetings shouldn't be more than 15 minutes (no one\n",
    "wants to stand for much longer), should be informal in nature, and can\n",
    "be daily, weekly, or whatever time period is warranted.\n",
    "Switch Seats\n",
    "Who said that a meeting with the boss has to mean meeting in the\n",
    "boss's office? If you're a supervisor, suggest meeting in your\n",
    "employee's office. If you're an employee scheduling a meeting, put the\n",
    "location in your office. There's something about sitting in the\n",
    "figurative driver's seat once in a while that helps break down some\n",
    "barriers. This idea, of course, assumes you have an office with a door\n",
    "and aren't in an open floor plan, where meeting will bother the people\n",
    "around you.\n",
    "If you're working on spicing up a group meeting, try changing up\n",
    "the location and seats. In one of my previous roles, we had two-hour\n",
    "meetings every week in the same room. Although the chairs were\n",
    "comfy and the white boards were handy, the room felt like it was\n",
    "caving in after a while. Managers don't always have to sit at the head\n",
    "of table. They are not your grandparent, and this is not Thanksgiving.\n",
    "\n",
    "A change of venue distributes the power. In the end, it can cultivate\n",
    "some awesome ideas in a new, freeing space.\n",
    "Move Your Chair\n",
    "If your desk is sandwiched between your chair and your visitor's,\n",
    "consider moving your chair to the side of your desk so you're almost\n",
    "sitting next to the person you're having a conversation with. When\n",
    "you're speaking with someone in your office, this simple shift of your\n",
    "chair makes the conversation more intimate and starts to break down\n",
    "that perceived force field that you can feel from having the desk in\n",
    "between you and them.\n",
    "Take Turns Leading\n",
    "Although this isn't a structural or physical change, giving someone\n",
    "else the opportunity to lead in a meeting can change the dynamics and\n",
    "enhance feedback and discussion. Are there parts of the agenda\n",
    "another employee could lead? Can teams alternate in leading each\n",
    "week? Give people the chance and show that you trust them to take\n",
    "ownership of discussions. This will give other employees confidence in\n",
    "presenting, while giving managers the ability to gauge an employee's\n",
    "leadership development. If you do try this strategy, make sure not to\n",
    "spring it on them at the last minute. Give them notice so they'll have\n",
    "time to prepare.\n",
    "Now, let's move on to some areas that I would consider middle\n",
    "ground. We're still not knocking down walls, but we are making\n",
    "changes to the way we work that might take a little more time to get\n",
    "used to.\n",
    "Reshape Your Tables\n",
    "When we think about people gathering for a meeting and sitting\n",
    "at one large table, it's pretty typically a rectangle or oblong shape. This\n",
    "boardroom-style table provides a head for someone to lead the\n",
    "meeting from, and it can be the most space efficient. Although this\n",
    "style is useful on some occasions, for the day-to-day functions and\n",
    "more casual team meetings, it perpetuates a hierarchical experience.\n",
    "The head of the table tends to be the person leading while everyone\n",
    "else sits around it.\n",
    "To even the playing field, it's best to find configurations that don't\n",
    "focus on one or a few people. Shapes that are more conducive to\n",
    "creating spaces for more open communication are\n",
    "Circular. Round tables work well to create a collaborative work\n",
    "environment for a small group of people. Even if it's just two\n",
    "\n",
    "employees, there's no clear divide or emphasis on one person over the\n",
    "other, and no matter where you sit, you're not choosing sides.\n",
    "Square. Square tables provide four even sides, and depending on\n",
    "the size, you can fit several in one room. If, at times, you need a more\n",
    "traditional board room for certain events, this style can easily be\n",
    "expanded to a rectangle by adding another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "“U” or “C.” These configurations work well for presentations,\n",
    "video conferences, small meetings, and workshops. These work best\n",
    "when you're looking to combine presentations and group interactions\n",
    "with discussions so everyone can physically see others in the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't to say you need to throw all of your rectangular tables\n",
    "to the curb. But if you're looking to update furniture or add some new\n",
    "pieces, the shapes just listed are worth considering instead of always\n",
    "going the regular rectangular route.\n",
    "Other styles to consider for trainings or company-wide meetings\n",
    "are\n",
    "School. Smaller rectangle tables with a few seats at each table\n",
    "facing forward. The table allows for participants to take notes, use\n",
    "their devices, and eat while listening to a speaker. This works best for\n",
    "trainings or seminars.\n",
    "\n",
    "V-shaped. This style is very similar to the school setup, but instead\n",
    "of the tables facing forward, they are angled to the center with an aisle\n",
    "in the middle—making a V shape. This small change in angle allows\n",
    "the person on the farthest end of each row to get a better view of the\n",
    "speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theatre. This is a row of chairs facing forward with an aisle in the\n",
    "center and space on the sides for people to walk up and down. This\n",
    "setup works for company-wide meetings or larger conferences. But if\n",
    "you're looking for interaction between the attendees or for them to\n",
    "take notes, this isn't the best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encourage Shared Spaces\n",
    "It's so easy for us to stay in one space if we don't have meetings\n",
    "and are buckling down to work through projects. But if everyone has\n",
    "their face down and is on the computer all day every day, we're in\n",
    "trouble. You can make minor changes that provide employees with\n",
    "opportunities to get out of their workspaces and interact with others\n",
    "while still enhancing productivity. These adjustments don't cost a lot\n",
    "and can even wind up saving money.\n",
    "• Create a centralized location for printing and limit machines in\n",
    "individual spaces.\n",
    "• Add communal trash and recycling bins to various locations across the\n",
    "office and remove cans from individual spaces so employees need to\n",
    "get up to throw something away.\n",
    "• Provide coat racks or closets in communal spaces and encourage\n",
    "hanging outerwear in those locations.\n",
    "• Encourage people to use centralized locations to enjoy their meal by\n",
    "offering tables, chairs, and booths at which people can gather.\n",
    "• Add inexpensive furniture (like ottomans and high-top tables) in\n",
    "\n",
    "communal spaces and encourage employees to use them for small\n",
    "group conversations.\n",
    "As with any type of change, it takes time to implement these\n",
    "things into company culture. Throwing a few bean bags in the center\n",
    "of the office won't necessarily bring people to these areas, but if\n",
    "leadership is promoting and using this space more, other employees\n",
    "are likely to follow. Communicate the impending changes by\n",
    "providing the necessary information, and offer a forum in which\n",
    "people can ask questions. This way everyone is well aware of where\n",
    "their trashcans went.\n",
    "HUMAN CONNECTION\n",
    "One of the biggest barriers to an open floor model is acoustical\n",
    "interruption. It's important to set precedents and protocols of how you\n",
    "collaborate in a space without interrupting someone else's ability to\n",
    "concentrate. Our company has made an active effort to establish these\n",
    "protocols. If your phone call or conversation is more than two minutes\n",
    "in an open area, we move it to a huddle room, or another enclosed\n",
    "location to be less disruptive. If we're presenting during a conference\n",
    "call or webinar, we use a meeting room. And if we're on a conference\n",
    "call where we won't be talking all that much, we stay in our\n",
    "workplace.\n",
    "We're also trying to promote the use of our work café by hosting\n",
    "continuing education courses every Tuesday and Thursday in that\n",
    "location. It has sound masking (white noise), a pantry set up with\n",
    "snacks and coffee, catering-sized refrigerators, a mug washer,\n",
    "upholstered steps to sit on, different sizes of tables and lounge seating,\n",
    "and loungers with articulated keyboard trays. We also have click-share\n",
    "to easily share what we're working on with our group. These varied\n",
    "spaces provide options for individuals and large and small teams to\n",
    "collaborate.\n",

    "Add Some Color\n",
    "The colors of our spaces have an impact on our moods, emotions,\n",
    "productivity, and interactions with others. According to a study from\n",
    "the University of Texas at Austin, employees who work in blue/green,\n",
    "blue, or subtle white spaces experience a higher level of satisfaction in\n",
    "their jobs and have increased performance.1 Knowing what mood and\n",
    "emotion a color brings is important when you're trying to create an\n",
    "inclusive and productive environment. Below are some other colors to\n",
    "consider when updating spaces:\n",
    "Red\n",
    "Soft shades can create a cozy environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Orange Earthy shades can bring feelings of relaxation.\n",
    "Purple Muted tones can create an airy atmosphere and richer tones bring\n",
    "thoughts of importance.\n",
    "White\n",
    "Tinted and softer shades create a more open and welcoming space.\n",
    "Yellow Softer tones can show hospitality and energy.\n",
    "Knock Down Walls\n",
    "Knocking down walls, rearranging workspaces, and investing in\n",
    "alternative furniture is no small task or expense. It's not something to\n",
    "be taken lightly and should be carefully considered, researched, and\n",
    "approved. Organizations that value a culture of openness and\n",
    "transparency don't always translate this into their structural spaces.\n",
    "And being able to identify what changes can be made within your\n",
    "organization before making huge adjustments is vital.\n",
    "Many companies, including Apple and Amazon are spending the\n",
    "time and money to ensure that their spaces encourage conversations\n",
    "and collaboration. But each situation is different, and how you define,\n",
    "and experience, collaboration and innovation will dictate the direction\n",
    "you take. Taking the time to gain a deeper insight into the structural\n",
    "needs of your employees will be well worth the effort.\n",
    "HUMAN CONNECTION\n",
    "At my last job, the entire organization moved from an old-school,\n",
    "brick office building into a brand new, modern high-rise. After decades\n",
    "of working in traditional, dry-walled offices, all of the departments\n",
    "were to be moved to an open concept, all-glass environment. It was a\n",
    "big change.\n",
    "Senior leadership knew there would be resistance and made a lot\n",
    "of effort to ease the transition. They sent out frequent messaging with\n",
    "updates, had open forums for asking questions, and even led hard-hat\n",
    "tours of the new space as it was it being built. They formed different\n",
    "committees open to everyone who wanted to be involved in the\n",
    "process: a community and culture committee for initiatives around\n",
    "creating a positive office culture, an art committee for selecting the art\n",
    "that would be displayed on the walls. And they actively and\n",
    "thoughtfully addressed employees' needs for new tools in order to\n",
    "adjust to the new space—noise canceling headphones for those who\n",
    "needed quiet to concentrate, computer monitor shades for those now\n",

    "Of course, there were always going to be employees who were\n",
    "negative—the ones who would complain no matter what. But there\n",
    "was also plenty of positivity and excitement. Yes, most employees\n",
    "were losing their private office spaces and the ability to close a door\n",
    "\n",
    "during a phone call. It was a drastic change in work space. But instead\n",
    "of an outright revolt from the staff, the good attitudes helped drown\n",
    "out the griping ones. Leadership empowered their employees to\n",
    "contribute to their new space, and it really made a difference in the\n",

    "COLLEEN, Marketing and Communications Professional\n",
    "Through my conversations with managers and employees, I found\n",
    "a common issue—they lack easy access to spaces for impromptu\n",
    "meetings. Whether they work in a building with private offices, open\n",

    "Some of the specialty spaces being designed to help organizations with\n",
    "these issues are\n",

    "hard for.\n",

    "One of the biggest barriers that perpetuates the feeling of them\n",

    "that we don't always see the people who keep our company above\n",

    "Insincere apologies. If you're going to give an insincere apology,\n",
    "you might as well not give one at all. If you're rolling your eyes and\n",

    "away. Insincere apologies just make the situation worse. If you need\n",
    "to, take some time to process everything before you take ownership\n",
    "and apologize. It's not about what you intend to say, it's about what\n",
    "you say, and how it makes someone feel. Your tone says it all, here are\n",
    "some examples of what not to do:\n",
    "[image] “Yeah, I'm sorry about that.” (said with a side eye and a\n",
    "snarky tone)\n",
    "[image] “I'm sorrrrry.” (said with a long drawn out accusatory\n",
    "sorry)\n",
    "[image] “Like I said, I'm sorry.” (said in an argumentative and\n",
    "accusatory tone)\n",
    "Defending your actions. Defending or making excuses doesn't make\n",
    "the other person feel any better. Focus on the other individual, not\n",
    "you. And leave the “coulda,” “shoulda,” “woulda” out of it. Avoid\n",
    "statements like, “Had you finished the project earlier, I could have\n",
    "answered the email on time. So really, mistakes were made on both\n",
    "sides.”\n",
    "Using indifferent statements. These statements turn the conversation\n",
    "in a different direction, potentially accusing someone else.\n",
    "[image] “Brooke, I'm sorry I offended you, but I've been having a\n",
    "really rough week.” This brings the conversation back to you and is\n",
    "making an excuse for your actions. Try instead: “Brooke, I apologize\n",
    "for my offensive actions.”\n",
    "[image] “Cole, I'm sorry if I upset you.” Not only is this not taking\n",
    "ownership for offensive actions, it also implies that Cole's feelings\n",
    "\n",
    "might not be warranted. Try “Cole, I'm sorry that I upset you.” Simply\n",
    "changing “if” to “that” provides an absolute statement of apology.\n",
    "[image] “Tate, I'm sorry you feel that way.” This is not accepting\n",
    "responsibility, while it also implies that Tate's feelings might not be\n",
    "genuine. Try: “Tate, I apologize for my comments that made you feel\n",
    "that way.” Similar to the previous suggestions, the adjustment of the\n",
    "language acknowledges the other person's feelings and takes\n",
    "responsibility for your actions.\n",

at work 1 Yes only 30 percent  So what does that mean for the other  70 percent Well theyre likely feeling unheard unseen and not  understood  Remember the last time someone didnt listen to  something you felt was important When they completely shot down  your idea or just ignored it Im sure it felt pretty crappy—in all of its  “Why am I even in this meeting” glory  But why is this the case Whats causing this feeling among so  many employees throughout the workplace  First lets look at how different todays modern workforce really is  Right now five generations are out there working together ranging in  age from 16 to over 75  And within these generations more and more  diversity has entered the mix  No matter whether you are looking at  gender race ethnicity or religion the workplace doesnt look like it  did 50 years ago or even 10 or 20  And then mixed in with those differences in age culture and  whatever else we have all sorts of different personalities Who we are  and how we think is made up of all of the experiences weve had in  our lives up until this point  Each individual brings their own way of  seeing things and expressing them into their careers and around that  conference room table  No two people—even if they share similar  backgrounds or demographics—have the same perspective  OK so after reviewing all of this its pretty clear that we have  many differences cropping up in the workplace  And its pretty safe to  say that these contribute to why so many employees are having  trouble getting through to their colleagues and bosses  So what do we  do about it  The first step is to recognize that these differences exist and that  theyre here to stay  We need to respect and embrace our varied  viewpoints and then we can start to communicate across not against  them  We need to accept these differences as a natural part of working  with others and we need to start actually listening to each other  Open  your ears to what others have to say  Open your mind to different  ideas and ways of thinking  Agree that youre likely to always disagree  on some things  But make it a point to at least start talking about what  these things are  This book provides handson tools to help you start and guide  these important conversations  It covers mediums and phrases to use  Strategies to enact  Physical spaces to build and transform  It explains  how taking a novel approach—for something big or something small  —can ultimately create the opportunity for new dialogue that gets you  moving forward  Well talk about how we can break down communication barriers  in our modern work environments and how this is just as important in  our digital spaces as it is in person or maybe even more so  Well  cover important questions How do we connect with our virtual  coworkers via technology How do we navigate change as leaders and  as employees When should we take a conversation out of an email  and into someones office  Other chapters talk about how we can make ourselves accessible  to build relationships why its important to be transparent and always  put all of our cards on the table and how to say no while still  fostering a culture of openness and creativity  Well get into tackling  challenges like departmental divides the silo effect and toxic  coworkers  And well also talk about some crucial—and sometimes hardto  have—discussions that need to start happening  How do we openly  talk about diversity inclusion and belonging How do we get out of  our comfort zones and start genuinely trying to understand where  people are coming from How do we make our workplaces more   human  Ultimately I hope you use the tools in this book to develop  stronger teams that are built on trust and authentic communication  This doesnt mean everyone will be best friends or highfiving across  cubicles  But it will mean respect clarity and directness—all made  possible with more productive communication  The majority of the advice in this book applies to both managers  and nonmanagers and can be used by employees at all levels of an  organization  If you are a manager use your influence to implement  these strategies and make your teams better  If youre not a manager  and read about an idea that would make sense in your organization  bring it up to your supervisor  Lets not think in terms of us versus  them  Were all in this together  Remember though there are no quick fixes  Working toward  change takes time  It takes conscious effort  This book is a good start  for getting everyone on the same page or at least in the same room  but I would be doing you a disservice if I said it answers any and all  questions about working in diverse workplaces  People and  environments are constantly changing and evolving and each  individual coworker or supervisor is always a person all their own  You should mold and adapt the strategies you find in the pages that  follow including the “Human Connections” Ive included from other  content experts to your own particular situations and relationships  But also remember this Every employee within an organization  can provide value  Every  Single  One  Everyone is in a position of  power to bring change to their role to their unit and to the overall  success of an organization  What makes you different is what makes  you great  So learn to appreciate these differences in your colleagues  and understand how these things might impact how they think act or  feel in the workplace  Doing so might be hard or uncomfortable but  invest in getting there  One conversation at a time  To continue learning head to www notokthatsokcoach combook  for additional resources and videos  PART I  The Advantages of Our Differences  CHAPTER 1  Putting Our Strengths into Action  THE BEST EMPLOYEES bring something to the table that no one  else can  But sometimes these talents and strengths are overlooked  underutilized or even mistaken for weaknesses  When we dont know  each others strengths were not maximizing the effectiveness of the  conversations we can have and were not making efficient use of our  talent resources  Taking the time to uncover each of our strengths  helps us understand why people communicate in certain ways and  what information they need to make decisions  Doing so also provides  us with insight into how we can adjust our own communication styles  to be more effective and it helps us get to the bottom of why we seem  to butt heads with certain people while having better synergy with  others  While at work have you ever encountered these scenarios  • Have you been a part of a brainstorm session where a few people seem  to have all the ideas while others silently listen  • Have you had a supervisor who constantly looks for more data and  facts before making a decision on beginning a new project while you  have been ready to start the project since before you even talked to  your supervisor  • Have you had a colleague who stops meetings and goes around the  room to see if anyone else has anything to say which adds another 20  minutes to your already long meeting  • Have you had a peer whos always 10 steps ahead of everyone else  while thinking through a project while youre just trying to focus on  what needs to be done by the end of the day  These are just a few examples of diverse strengths being applied  in the workplace  We all think and act differently and although  certain actions may be frustrating to you they are not necessarily bad  This is how others utilize their strengths to benefit their work and  they should not be thought of as right or wrong  In fact the way you  conduct yourself in meetings at work may be just as frustrating to  others  If you dont know where someone is coming from or why they  complete tasks the way they do it can be infuriating  For instance the people who are silent in your brainstorm session  might be deliberating about what to say and how to say it  They might  not talk a lot but when they do it is logical well thought out and can  be something no one else has thought of before  And that supervisor who always wants data to support their  decisions It might appear to you as if theyre holding you back from  moving forward but theyre likely working through potential pitfalls  and managing risk for the success of the project  Theyre concerned  about doing things right and thoroughly the first time  The annoying colleague who spends extra time going around the  room to get feedback is making sure everyones opinion is heard  Doing so might make the meeting go longer eye rolls inserted here  but what they really want is to ensure that the group is not missing  any details and that all attendees feel valued and are given the chance  to share their insight  And your peer who is already 10 steps ahead What theyre really  doing is thinking about the future and what the project will look like  as a whole  Its important to them to be inspired by thinking about  what could be and how what youre working on right now will  positively impact the big picture  HUMAN CONNECTION  I was working with a team to put together a self and  management assessment  There was an employee from IT a project  manager and two representatives from human resources including  myself on our team  I wanted to ensure that peoples strengths were  coming out and that I was using them correctly  We all had previously  taken the CliftonStrengths assessment to identify our top five talents  During the process the project manager was always looking for  background information  She would ask questions about what had  been done in the past that led us to this point to make a change  She  wanted to understand the history so she could make better decisions  moving forward  She was utilizing her strength of Context  My colleague in human resources wanted deadlines and  deliverables throughout the process to ensure he knew what he was  responsible for and to keep others on track which was his strength of  Responsibility  The IT staff member used his Futuristic strength and  asked a lot of questions to get a better understanding of the project  He wanted to look past the utilization of the tool to see how we would  implement the assessment in our performance conversations  He also  wanted to know what reports would need to be generated and how  leaders and managers would be using that data  These pertinent  questions helped him design the form in a way that would allow us to  filter reports to meet our needs  This project was really interesting because we were all attacking  the same problem but from different perspectives  Once we  understood each others strengths and why we were either asking  questions wanting deadlines or needing context it made it easier for  us to work together  We achieved a better result because we knew  where we were all coming from  HEATHER Z  KAY Gallup Certified Strengths Coach  Identifying Strengths  When we inspect the preceding scenarios with this lens we can  see how our employees coworkers and supervisors used their  strengths to enhance the team  But when were living through such  instances it feels like the people we work with are going out of their  way to make our job harder  In reality theyre applying their strengths  to work through things in their own way  A strength is something that comes naturally to us and gives us the  highest confidence in the outcome we produce  We all have strengths  Even if you dont realize it you are subconsciously acting in certain  ways because of them  And although its great that we all have them  how can we proactively identify them for ourselves and others How  can identifying these strengths give us perspective on how we apply  them Likewise how can we use them to better understand our  colleagues Here are some suggestions  Look inward  It can be hard to look internally identify what makes  you unique and see what you bring to the table  Move beyond the  basic “What are my strengths” and ask yourself specific questions  image During which tasks do I lose track of time  image What am I working on right now that Im excited about  image What is an accomplishment Im proud of and why  Ask directly  When youre trying to identify your teammates or  employees strengths reframe the questions above and ask them  directly  image “What do your coworkers rely on you most for”  image “During which tasks do you lose track of time”  image “What are you working on right now that youre excited  about”  image “What is an accomplishment youre proud of and why”  Ask others  Another way to gain perspective on your coworkers  strengths is to ask people who work with them on a consistent and  ongoing basis  It can be the colleague that sits next to them or an  employee in another department who uses them as a resource  image “What type of work do they tend to ask to do”  image “What energizes them”  image “What tasks make them light up”  image “When do they seem most engaged”  Observe  Take time to observe others strengths in action  Its not  necessarily about what theyre doing but how theyre doing it  Two  people can accomplish the same task but they might go about it in  different ways  Whereas one person might gather data to make a  decision another may speak to colleagues and gather previous  experiences  Look at how theyre successfully accomplishing their  tasks  Dont turn this into a National Geographic research assignment  but do it casually to observe your coworkers acting naturally  Take an assessment psychometric assessment or inventory  Several  assessments help us identify how and why we work the way we do  Some of the more popular ones are CliftonStrengths Gallup  Everything DiSC Wiley and Character Strengths The VIA Institute  on Character 1 By bringing these inventories and assessments to your  organization you have made it possible for everyone to have a  common language and to more easily understand each others  strengths  ASSESSMENT  PSYCHOMETRIC  ASSESSMENT  OR  INVENTORY  DESCRIPTION  CliftonStrengths  • Measures the greatest potential for building  strength by identifying recurring patterns of  thought feeling and behavior  • The positive psychology approach focuses on  34 talent themes within four domains of  leadership Relationship Building  Influencing Strategic Thinking Executing 2  Everything DiSC  • Measures the degree of Dominance Influence  Steadiness and Conscientious behavior  • Focuses on how someone prefers to act what  they do and their behavior 3  VIA  Character  Strengths  • Measures positive traits of personality present  not only during times of excellence but in  everyday moments and in times of resilience  • The positive psychology approach focuses on  24 VIA character strengths that are the  pathways to each of the five areas of well  being positive emotion more engagement  better relationships more meaning more  accomplishments 4  When were able to identify people using their strengths and begin  appreciating them real change can happen  Well then start to see  employees looking forward to going to work having more positive  interactions with others and coming up with innovative solutions to  complex tasks  TACTICS TO IDENTIFY STRENGTHS  •  Look inward  •  Ask directly  •  Observe  •  Take an assessment psychometric assessment or inventory  Cluing into Strengths  Through these conversations youll most likely uncover things  that you never knew about yourself colleagues supervisors and  employees  Its pretty rare that we take the opportunity to step back  and reflect on what we enjoy doing and what comes naturally to us in  the workplace  This makes it even more important to listen attentively  for cues and clues that can help us make the most out of our strengths  In my work with clients I use CliftonStrengths to identify  individual talents to create more cohesive teams  Within the context of  this assessment the talent themes fall into four domains 5  Relationship Building  Accept and include others  bring people together actively  listen  Influencing  Help others get their  voices heard be able to sell  ideas and convince others  Strategic Thinking  Analyze information to inform  their decisions by thinking about  current and future problems  Executing  Set goals and have the  stamina to get things done  quickly and accurately  Whether or not you use the CliftonStrengthsGallup assessment  these four domains provide a good framework of the talents to look  for  When youre creating teams not only is it important to have  people who are creative and come up with great ideas but also to have  individuals who can sell those ideas to others  In addition you want  people who can spot pitfalls and have strategic backup plans along  with employees who help others get their voices heard and know who  to bring together in the first place  In your conversations and selfreflection listen for people who  • Put plans into action  • Ask targeted and strategic questions  • Others want to be around  • Can sell snow to a snowman  • Bring diverse groups of people together  These strengths can show themselves in a variety of ways  • Maybe Donna is always making lists and checking things off  This  could be a sign of her strength to keep track of tasks and follow  through  She may be the person you rely on to make sure the team  finishes what they started and who knows what theyre supposed to be  doing in the first place  • Maybe Linda is always taking the time to coach younger staff and  teach them the ropes  This could be a sign of her strength in  development  She would be a great asset when youre bringing in new  hires and may be able to lead employee orientation  • Maybe Yale is always organizing group happy hours and showing his  strength for bringing people together  His energetic spirit is just what  the group needs when youre having a tough quarter  • Maybe Natalie is always stopping at peoples desks to strike up a  conversation  Her strength of communicating with others is an asset  and can be leveraged during prospective client meetings and  networking events  These subtle and not so subtle actions are important to look out  for especially if you notice a pattern  Take note of them and use this  information to inform future conversations team development and  task assignments  Individual Strengths Equal Stronger  Teams  Now that you have a better grasp on your teammates strengths  its time to engage in authentic communication  Through these  conversations you can gain a better perspective on the way they work  while sharing your appreciation of what they bring to the team  This  also gives you the chance to be more strategic about what projects you  assign or ask for in hopes of producing more efficient and creative  outcomes  To get the most out of your coworkers your employees  and your own personal strengths try these strategies  Provide strengthsbased feedback  Share exactly how you saw your  employees strengths in action  How did they enhance the team  project assignment or organization as a whole What unique  contribution did they make “Xavier I was impressed with how you  were able to get our team to openly share their ideas at the last  meeting  Your individualized approach helped us gather some great  concepts for the project ”  As a peer take a moment to compliment your coworker  “Myla I  was really impressed with the presentation you gave to the investors  yesterday  You were really confident answered their questions with  ease and I learned a lot about our new initiatives  Thank you for  volunteering to do it ”  Align tasks with strengths  Move past a onesizefitsall management  style and tailor projects to the strengths of individual employees  Make  an effort to be more proactive in what responsibilities you assign by  asking what your employees enjoy working on and what they want to  learn  Employees who do work they enjoy and are good at are more  engaged and more likely to see a future with their company  As an employee reflect on the projects youre currently working  on and ask your supervisor for other work that aligns with your  strengths  “I really enjoy speaking on behalf of our group to the  investors  Are there any upcoming opportunities to do that”  Find unique professional development opportunities  Whether it is by  providing occasions for employees to take a course attend a  conference or speak at a seminar explore ways for your employees to  build on their strengths  If youre sent an email invitation for a  professional development event invite an employee to join you or  pass the invitation along to an employee or colleague who you think  would like it  As an employee make it a point to advocate for yourself and ask  to register for an online course or program that aligns with your  strengths  Specifically share how this will benefit the organization  “Brian I would like to go to the annual sales conference in May  The  agenda is packed with sessions that focus on building relationships as  part of the sales process  This is a strength of mine that I would like to  take to the next level to land Games Inc  as our new client ”  HUMAN CONNECTION  Its easy to stay in the bubble of the daytoday in the workplace  but professional development can really enhance an employees  growth and longterm retention  As an organization we recognize its  importance and give each staff member the opportunity to attend at  least one event if not more  During my quarterly review meetings I  make an active effort to bring up opportunities and gauge interest in  specific areas  This helps me to be more targeted in making  suggestions for upcoming events certifications and courses  I actively  forward emails and flyers and have oneonone conversations on  opportunities aligned with their interests  I want my employees to  know that I am invested in their professional success and will advocate  for additional resources and development on their behalf  SCOTT J  ROMEIKA Senior Director of Academic and Student Affairs of  the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania  Form diverse teams  Bring together employees with various  strengths  Find people who are creative and strategic thinkers who  follow through and who influence others to make decisions  When we  create teams of people who all think and act similarly were missing  out on new concepts and the ability to challenge ideas to come up  with better solutions  Ask the peers you asked to join the team for their input or critical  feedback on what youre working on  Did you miss anything Is there  something they would adjust or change Identify peers who look at  things differently  This will bring your assignment to the next level  Focus on the result  As a manager or team leader when you focus  more on the what like deadlines and expectations as opposed to  giving specific direction on the how to get it done youre letting  employees play to their strengths to figure it out  Share the results  youre looking for without micromanaging the details of how  employees need to go about a specific project while still making sure  theyre following the internal controls in completing the project  For  example if your nonprofit has a group goal of 100000 for this  campaign and individual goals of 10000 per team member let each  member of your team share how they plan to raise the money  One  person may volunteer to teach a series of workout classes in exchange  for donations while another might meet one on one with their donor  connections  Be vulnerable  Let your colleagues know when they get the best of  you the worst of you what they can count on you for and what you  need from them to do your job  “I need time to research before coming  up with new concepts ” “You get the best version of me when you  provide me with the space to think through ideas ” “You can count on  me to spot pitfalls and come up with alternative solutions ” “You get  the worst side of me when I feel rushed or put on the spot to provide  information or be creative ”  Get an outsiders perspective  Consider bringing in a consultant or  outside company to assess the strengths of your teams and employees  to maximize their abilities  It can be hard to participate in trainings if  youre the one leading them so getting someone with a fresh  perspective from outside your workplace dynamics can take your  team to the next level  STRATEGIES TO TAP INTO STRENGTHS  •  Provide strengthsbased feedback  •  Align tasks with strengths  •  Find unique professional development opportunities  •  Form diverse teams  •  Focus on the result  •  Be vulnerable  •  Get an outsiders perspective  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Although our strengths can be a huge asset in the workplace they  can also cause a lot of drama  When we dont understand why people  work the way they do its easy to get frustrated and not appreciate  their contributions especially when we would go about it a different  way  But understanding and leveraging our strengths—and the  strengths of those who work with and for us—leads to enhanced  productivity and engagement  CHAPTER 2  Navigating the Multigenerational  Workforce  WHEN WE TALK about generations were not just talking about a  standard set of birth years  Generations are defined by technology  pivotal events sociological trends and economics during our  formative years  These areas shape the way we think about the world  around us and guide our interactions with others  But what happens when we work with people from other  generations and dont understand where theyre coming from What do  we do when someone is stuck in their own generational work style  • We start perpetuating stereotypes about a generation  • We link differences to lack of competence and work ethic  • We avoid others because we dont know the best medium in which to  communicate  • We provide old incentives that no longer motivate or inspire  • We dont achieve personal or professional growth because were stuck  in our ways  Even in what seem to be the best workplace environments  communication breakdowns are bound to happen with varying  personalities and age groups  If we dont try to understand the  situations and experiences that make us who we are well be stuck in  a breakdown loop  The first step to moving forward is to have  conversations across generations and get to know the people we work  with  One of the exercises I do when facilitating workplace trainings is  to have participants create a timeline of major national events that  happened during their childhood  Examples of these include 911 the  2008 recession the Great Depression legalization of gay marriage the  rise of social media and computers and civil rights activism  Each  participant then shares how this event has impacted their life their  communication preference and style and their interactions with  others  Answers vary from having less trust in large systems like banks  to being able to see daily pictures of their grandchildren on Facebook  This icebreaker helps provide some insight into how these shared  experiences affected our lives even if we may not have realized it  Its  a startingoff point for future discussions on deeper issues that can  influence the way we work together  Although its important to have these conversations and navigate  multigenerational workforces to understand why we act the way we  do we should not box in or generalize all people within a generation  Generations are made of individuals not carbon copies or robots  However understanding and navigating this landscape will help us  identify ways to communicate and motivate individuals within the  generations  Five Generations in the Workforce  Currently five generations are in the workforce Traditionalists  Silent Generation Baby Boomers Gen X Millennials and Gen Z  In  general each one is looking for something different from their  coworkers supervisors and organizations  Understanding these  differences can help us tap into more meaningful conversations that  will help retain employees in the long term and keep our relationships  strong  Lets look at each generation and how to tap into their key  motivators  Remember this doesnt apply to every person in each  generation but it does give you a better idea of where they might be  coming from  Traditionalists  Traditionalists were born between 1925 and 1946  Many were  raised during the Great Depression and value their jobs  Many have  also worked for one company over the lifetime of their career are  extremely loyal and get along well with their colleagues  In the workplace a Traditionalist might be known as the  figurehead of an organization  This rings true especially with family  owned businesses that have been passed down to future generations  Although many Traditionalists are retired some are also being asked  to come back on a consulting basis to help the newer generations  navigate the business  The key to working with Traditionalists is to  keep them up to speed on the technology used within the organization  and to create environments in which they feel valued and not pushed  aside for a newer model  Top motivators  Respect and recognition  Give subtle and  personalized recognition and feedback  Take the time to say thank you  and acknowledge their service to the organization  Talk about their  positive impact on getting newer employees up to speed  Its important  to respect how theyve accomplished tasks in the past while working  together to find new solutions  What they bring to the table  Traditionalists bring institutional  knowledge and a strong work ethic  Baby Boomers  Baby Boomers were born between 1946 and 1964  Although on  average about 10000 Boomers are retiring each day many are  choosing to stay in the workforce either full or parttime 1 Because the  2008 recession forced many to deplete their retirement funds and  modern medicine is helping them live longer and healthier lives this  generation is extending their stay in the workforce  Baby Boomers are  known for their optimism and their value of hard work  Compared to the previous generation Boomers grew up being  surrounded by more people in their families neighborhoods and  classrooms  This helped them develop a sense of comradery and  competition 2 Although Boomers may not have grown up with  computers its important to not underestimate their interest and  knowledge in the newest technology  They have been building in  person relationships for as long as they can remember so if there is a  barrier between them and the person they are trying to interact with  it can be a turnoff  Boomers also have a lot of crucial institutional  knowledge to pass along and if we dont tap into it it will go out the  door with them when they retire  Top motivators  Acknowledgment and financial stability  Take time  to recognize their efforts and service to the organization in person and  with financial compensation  Look for opportunities for them to  mentor employees and for them to be seen as valued experts  As  theyre retiring theyre continuing to plan for financial stability  beyond their time within your organization so financial recognition  through bonuses and other means are coveted  What they bring to the table  Boomers are optimistic and  hardworking  Gen X  Gen Xers were born between 1965 and 1980  This generation is  also known for being latchkey kids as they usually came home from  school to an empty home the first generation with both parents in the  workforce  In many cases they were responsible for themselves and  their siblings  So as independent children they grew into independent  employees who get the job done and desire to work without  micromanagement  As managers Gen Xers also expect others to work independently  with little direction  They want to make an impact and be proud of  what they accomplish at work  They can often find it difficult to be  passed up for promotions in favor of younger generations  Many have  waited a long time for their Baby Boomer bosses to retire and feel  overlooked in favor of Millennials who swooped in for a role the Gen  Xers sought  They want to work on meaningful projects where they  can tap into their years of knowledge and experience  Top motivators  Autonomy and worklife balance  Give them an  assignment and let them run with it without constantly checking in on  their progress  Explore alternative ways for them to work from home  and other locations  What they bring to the table  Gen Xers are selfstarters responsible  and results driven  Millennials  Millennials were born between 1980 and 1996  Millennials grew  up with rapidly improving technology from pagers to smart phones  When they were children they typically had jampacked schedules  filled with afterschool activities  They are used to working with  teams receiving participation trophies and eating avocado toast OK  not all of them and they value mentoring and coaching from their  supervisors  Millennials see advancement as something that is earned  through their outcomes—like what they produce or achieve—and not  through tenure or time spent in the office  Millennials are helpers looking to make their mark and quickly  move up in the workforce while advocating for worklife balance  They like to make processes more efficient and dont understand  having to stick around the office if theyve completed their work for  the day  They are quick to move on to another opportunity if one  presents itself or if they arent moving quickly enough in their current  role  This can lead to employers being frustrated about their level of  loyalty  Top motivators  Access opportunity to learn and grow and work  life balance  Provide consistent and ongoing feedback and access to  higherlevel meetings where they can share their ideas  Give them an  opportunity to flex their muscles and learn something new and  embrace their desire for collaboration  What they bring to the table  Millennials are confident globally  minded and purposedriven  Gen Z  Gen Z was born between 1996 and 2010  Technology has always  been a part of their lives they dont remember a time without social  media or the internet and most were never exposed to the peril of  dialup internet  Although they like to work in groups they want to  know how their individual contribution had an impact on the team as  well as how their team did  Gen Z wants space to think outside the  box freedom to identify a new process or procedure and the  flexibility to work on their side hustle or passion project  Top motivators  Community involvement opportunities for flexible  learning worklife balance  Take them seriously listen to their ideas  give public praise and provide opportunities for them to learn through  technology  Make them part of creating sustainable change and  finding ways to give back to the community  Provide social rewards  for completion of learning programs and initiate reverse mentoring  opportunities  What they bring to the table  Gen Z is tech savvy values diversity  and is socially responsible  You might be thinking Why isnt money the first thing on each of  these lists of motivators Dont get me wrong everyone wants to be  compensated fairly  But just throwing around money without more  thoughtful strategies isnt going to work with the new generations of  employees  They want to be part of work cultures that provide more  than just a steady paycheck  They want to know theyre making a  difference and consistently learning new skills while working with  people they enjoy being around  GENERATION TOP MOTIVATORS  WHAT THEY BRING  Traditionalists  • Respect  • Recognition  • Institutional  knowledge  • Strong work ethic  Baby Boomers  • Acknowledgment  • Financial stability  • Optimistic  • Hard working  Gen Xers  • Autonomy  • Worklife balance  • Selfstarters  • Responsible  • Results driven  Millennials  • Access  • Opportunity to learn and  grow  • Worklife balance  • Confident  • Globally minded  • Purpose driven  Gen Zers  • Community involvement  • Opportunities for flexible  learning  • Worklife balance  • Tech savvy  • Value diversity  • Socially responsible  Stop Generation Shaming  Regardless of their generation everyone wants to be valued  respected and heard  But each one of us might express our thoughts  and receive information differently  One of my clients was struggling  with how some of their Baby Boomer employees were trying to build  personal relationships with Millennial employees  A few of these  employees read articles that recommended specific methods for  communicating with each generation  The Boomer employees then  went on to use this information to inform how they communicated  with all of their coworkers of various generations  They walked to the  offices of their Baby Boomer peers emailed Gen X colleagues and  texted Millennials  On the surface this seemed fine but it soon started  to stir up some controversy because people did not understand why  they were getting an email when someone else was getting a faceto  face conversation  By limiting inperson conversation to only certain  coworkers these employees unintentionally made others feel left out  and undervalued  A Millennial client I spoke with had just started with a new  company and was used to instant messaging IMing members of their  team and supervisor to ask questions  At their old company this was  an established protocol and an easier way for coworkers to  communicate with one another without leaving their spaces  A few  weeks into their new role many Baby Boomers on their team voiced  frustration at the constant pinging through IM which was interrupting  their workflow in addition they were having a hard time keeping up  with the pace of the typed conversation  The more seasoned  employees were used to popping into one anothers offices and sending  emails to ask questions and gain clarification  The new employees  primary form of communication was seen as more of a distraction than  an efficient communication method  A Gen X client of mine had a question for a Millennial employee  and opted to give them a call on their cell phone  The Millennial  answered the phone and was not only frustrated that their coworker  had called but that they hadnt texted first to see if it was OK  The  Millennial employee saw it as an invasion of privacy and wanted a text  to give them a heads up  Whats the missing component in these scenarios An initial  conversation  Although the chart below provides general tips for  communication preferences its essential to ask individuals one of  these variations  • “What is the best way to communicate with you”  • “What is your preferred method of communication”  • “How can I best get in touch with you if I have a question”  Maybe your Millennial peer would rather you pop into their office  and your Baby Boomer colleague wants a text  Youll never know  unless you ask  And it will give you a better idea as to why you have  10 missed calls and no voicemails  Remember generations are made  up of individual people—not clones  GENERATION COMMUNICATION PREFERENCE  Traditionalist  • Direct inperson conversation Share information  and facts first followed by exactly what you want  them to complete including a timeline  • Handwritten Although you might not be writing  agendas or notes with paper and pen be prepared to  receive and accept information in this form unless  you explicitly state that you need it electronically  Baby Boomer  • Structure Provide a wellwritten agenda before  meetings and outlined structure for projects and  assignments  • Scheduled conversation Set aside time for formal  and scheduled inperson communication  • Informative emails Send educational emails that  provide value  Gen X  • Informal conversations Pop in to their workspace  to ask a question and have an impromptu versus all  scheduled meeting  • Email Use email to communicate  This allows them  to work on their own time schedule and share  information  • Brief overview They want basic questions answered  What is the task and when is it due What do I need  to do to get it done Once these questions are  answered they want to complete the assignment with  little oversight  Millennial  • Structure and clear goals Give them clear deadlines  and expectations for assignments and projects  • Instant communication Send quick texts or  messages instead of long emails  • Reciprocal dialogue Include them in the  conversation and dont dictate how they need to do  something focus on the results youre looking for  Gen Z  • Instant communication Find time to provide  frequent quick and preferably daily feedback  This  can be in person or through technology and can take  less than five minutes no lengthy emails are needed  • Infotainment Share information in quick and fun  ways short videos reviewing a process and on  demand learning for new skills  • Structure clear directions and transparency Be  specific about what you would like them to  accomplish and share any updatesinsights dont  hide information or resources  Interestingly one of the most effective ways to communicate  across generations is face to face  Despite being brought up with  technology even the younger generations are looking for more in  person contact  According to a study conducted by Randstad and  Future Workplace 53 percent of Gen Z and Millennials prefer in  person communication over tools like instant messaging and video  conferencing  In fact fewer than 20 percent of both generations prefer  email 3 This is something to keep in mind as emails seemingly  dominate our communications  Millennials and Gen Z rank it as one of  their less preferred communication methods and would rather talk  with you face to face  Communication Partnerships  Reverse mentoring is a great way to give employees of two different  generations typically one older and one younger a chance to learn  from one another  Its a mutual partnership that helps bridge skill gaps  and can be a refreshing change of pace for both parties  For example a  Gen Z employee may be able to share their experience working with  the latest social sharing website with the Boomer and explain how  using it can increase sales of a new product whereas the Boomer may  be able to provide the Gen Z employee with access to higherlevel  meetings  This access can give the Gen Z employee a chance to meet  the senior leadership team  Unlike your typical mentormentee  relationship both parties are teaching and learning from each other  Some opportunities for discussion include sharing the following  • Emerging trends technology and products within your industry  • Institutional knowledge of policies and procedures  • Strategies to enhance interpersonal relationships and soft skills  • Untapped outlets to reach a younger demographic  • Preferred mediums to better communicate with your staff  The Ageless Challenge of Communication  No matter what you know about someone else and their  generation there is always the potential for communication hiccups  And ultimately these issues can get in the way of you making progress  with your coworkers and supervisors  Regardless of the medium you  use to deliver your message the barriers discussed next will quickly  halt your conversations—or prevent them from even happening in the  first place  The Balancing Act  Even if you uncover the preferred method of communication it  can seem like youre doing a lot of juggling  Hali would rather you pop  in his office Rachel wants a text Howard only wants to talk on the  phone and Jeff loves sending everything through IM  As youre trying  to piece together everyones preferences you might find yourself  wondering why you asked in the first place  The key to juggling preferences is to find a place of mutual  understanding  If you dont youll find yourself covering your office  with sticky notes sending yourself reminders of everyones personal  favorites or just choosing what you prefer  During your initial  communication conversations nail down how you can contact one  another for questions that need immediate answers and action  “If one  of my clients needs a work order processed by the end of the business  day what is the best way to reach you” During these cases you  usually want to defer to their communication preference to ensure that  you get the answers you need in time  For nonurgent matters work together on a plan in which youre  both leaning in and provide the “why” behind it so youre both on the  same page  For instance “I appreciate that you would prefer to have a  text  conversation  when  you  have  questions  about  client  documentation  Although I understand that this method may be easier  this information is confidential and needs to be recorded in our system  and tracked for billing purposes  I would be happy to give you a heads  up via text that I sent an email if that would help ”  If youre having a conversation with your manager consider  leaning in more to their preferred communication style  At the end of  the day if you want a response its about the receivers preference and  not the senders  “Dont Patronize Me Sweetie”  Although your coworkers or managers may be the same age as  your parents grandparents children or even grandchildren they  should not be treated as if they are  When you treat someone like your  flaky little sister or talk to someone like theyre your grandmother who  cannot figure out how to unlock her phone—youre talking down to  them  Phrases like “Well dear thats not how we do it around here”  “Youre so cute just like my grandma” or “Aw thats so sweet that  you think it will work” all fall under this umbrella  Just because  someone is older doesnt mean they dont understand technology  And  just because someone is younger doesnt make their suggestion any  less important to listen to  HUMAN CONNECTION  When I was working in retail full time my manager was more  than 10 years younger than me  She was a remarkable young woman  who had been in the industry since she was 16  She knew her job and  performed it very well  She was very business minded and was able to  communicate the value of every employee making her easy to respect  and appreciate  I learned a great deal from her  It was a fairly common occurrence that customers would come  into the store and want to speak to the manager and then stand in  front of me  The assumption was that because I was senior in age I  was of course the senior in position  I would just smile and call for my  young boss and explain that she was the manager and I was still in  training Most people apologized and laughed  On occasion one would  argue thinking I was just trying to blow them off  As I continued in retail I found myself in a place where I was  hiring staff who were the same age as and some even younger than my  children  The challenge here was to stay professional to manage the  staff member and not parent the child  JUDY Former Retail Professional  “My Boss Is How Old”  When we dont trust people its hard to have an authentic  conversation  This is especially true when younger employees are  supervising others of an older generation  These young supervisors and  leaders are often questioned about whether they know what theyre  doing and why they got the job over someone with more tenure at the  organization  If youre a younger manager be honest with your employees and  ask them for support and to share their experiences  “I recognize that I  am newer in this role and many of you have been with the company  for several years  I value your knowledge and experience and am  looking forward to working with and learning from you ”  This can be an awkward situation and it may be even a little  embarrassing for older employees who are now answering to a  younger manager  But you need to build trust with your team through  honesty action and consistent transparency  Communicate to them  that you need their knowledge and support in order for your team to  be successful  For instance you might say “Betty I know you have a  ton of experience working with this client  Do you think we could  meet sometime this week to share your pointers with me”  HUMAN CONNECTION  There have been numerous occasions where I have been younger  than other employees on my team  Ive heard them say that I wasnt  deserving to be in my role because “I havent done my time” like they  have  And why would the company hire someone “so young and  inexperienced” On one occasion I decided to speak up about the  hurtful comments of one coworker and said “Time is only what you  make of it and I work hard to make every minute count  However if  you think Id benefit from your experience and you are willing to share  your knowledge to better support the team Id love to have the  opportunity to learn from you and Id appreciate you sharing your  candid thoughts ”  One of my peers overheard our conversation and said to my  coworker “You could also benefit from taking some reverse mentoring  from this young mind and if you did youd know that she has no need  to prove herself because she will outperform every individual on this  team and shell be the best team player and genuine person you have  ever worked with ” After our very public conversation I asked the  individual who made the hurtful comment one on one if they would  be my mentor and educate me on the experiences that they thought I  could learn from  They also asked for my mentorship  We formed a  personal and professional relationship and over time they admitted  that it was nice seeing a different and new perspective and understood  why I was hired  They also apologized for their previous comments  I learned that you should always try to keep an open mind and  give your team members the benefit of the doubt even if they may not  have that same mindset  We can all benefit from helping and learning  from one another  Its such a simple practice but one that is not  practiced enough  KATHERINE LA HART PhD of Business Administration  “I Dont Need Any Help”  No one wants to be the one who doesnt know how to do  something  Especially if that person has been at the company for a  long time and is used to people coming to them for answers  It can be  difficult for older generations to ask younger colleagues for support on  a project or about how to use a newer piece of technology  If you  notice someone struggling ask if you can lend a hand  “What do you  need from me to be more comfortable with our new learning  management system” If youre the one struggling and are looking for  support find a colleague with whom youve developed a relationship  and start there  They may not know the answer but they might be  able to point you in the direction of someone who does  For example  “Arthur would you be able to show me how our new phone system  works Im having a hard time transferring calls ”  Its a lot easier to ask for help from people you have a relationship  with than to ask someone you hardly know  “I Know It All”  When employees have an idea that theyre excited and passionate  about they tend to share it and try to get everyone on board  Its  commonly shared that Millennials tend to be quick to provide a  solution or suggestion and dont always approach the situation in a  tactful way  You could be in the middle of explaining something and  someone else jumps in pushing their newer and better way  Or worse  someone is not open to learning new information because they think  they know it all  Have conversations as a group on when and how to  present new ideas  You dont want to belittle anyones concept or stifle  any creativity but its important to address how these things should be  presented  Its also important to keep an open mind and know that you  can learn something from any conversation  HUMAN CONNECTION  The ink from my diploma had barely dried and I was in a  conference room with my boss an innovative and outofthebox  thinker and directors of IT Marketing Compliance Operations and  Legal  They had all been with the business for many years and knew  the ins and outs of the industry  They were asking me the recent  college graduate how I thought we could reengage the business of  nearly one thousand employees  I saw it as a test they wanted to see if  I was going to use the opportunity to get on my soapbox or if I was  going to make real use of the time  I had ideas what I now know were  naïve aspirations and ideals but I hadnt established my credibility  and this was my moment—I was either going to blow them away with  an idea that they never heard before or reframe the situation  I wasnt  confident enough or knowledgeable enough to spit out some  revolutionary idea for employee engagement and lets face it these  professionals would most likely have seen heard and probably tried  whatever I was going to suggest so before I shared my idea I asked  “Well what has been done before What did employees experience  before and what did they like what would they never want to do”  Conversation ensued and I learned that the business had a very  riskaverse approach—the teams were forged together with seniority  and relationships—and that the average age of employees was close to  forty a stark contrast from my days of working with earlytwenty  something year olds  This key finding showed that by me asking  questions and not just listening but actively listening I was building  trust  I showed respect for the leaders by gathering information before  blurting out the sexy new organizational topic I just read about in  Harvard Business Review  I wanted to gamify the workplace and before  I could say that I had to work with my boss and those very leaders to  make sure this idea would actually take root in the office  I had to  make sure it wasnt just my idea but our idea  After discussing the past practices of the business I suggested this  generic answer “Lets make it fun After all engagement is about  having fun and being invested in something youre interested in ” And  then the meeting ended  I walked back to my office with my boss  When we got there he challenged me “What is fun” I didnt know  but neither did he nor did anyone else in the meeting and thats  where the team came in we needed to work together to establish fun  My boss and I worked diligently over the next few months researching  experiential learning and recruiting consultants to design simple yet  effective games  Months later we had developed the “Strategy  Engagement Path” where we went from team to team and spoke  about the business the strategy challenges in the industry and how  each department contributed to the overall mission  There were your  standard business presentations and periods of competition to link  each teams work back to the bigger mission of the company  At the  end of the path the teams would map themselves on our strategy map  and explain how they affected the overall business and of course we  had an award ceremony to crown the victors and these werent  Millennials so everyone didnt get a prize  JOHN HERBUT Insurance  Writing Off What You Dont Know  “Youre doing what on your smartphone” “Wait youre reading a  newspaper made of paper” If youre finding it hard to relate to  someone from another generation try keeping up to date on trends in  your industry—this is something you can both connect on  Read  articles or hey just keep reading and recommending this book  stream an episode of the latest bingeworthy show listen to a top  podcast or find really anything that could serve as a point of  connection when chatting with your coworker  Dont know what this  might be Ask other people who speak that “language” for  suggestions  Keep It Quick  Studies show that Millennials have an attention span of twelve  seconds while Gen Z is down to just eight  To put that into  perspective a goldfish has an attention span of nine seconds 4 It can be  hard to communicate when the other person is already moving on to  the next thing  Providing feedback in quick easy and digestible bites  will go a long way  Find small chunks of time to have these  conversations and avoid longwinded emails or conversations unless  absolutely necessary  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  At the end of the day people are people with unique experiences  and viewpoints  Lets stop generation shaming—from “theyre too old  to understand technology” to “all Millennials are just lazy and dont  know a thing about loyalty ” Lets get to know the people we work  with  by  asking  them  questions  about  their  experiences  communication preferences and motivations  The more we get to  know people as people the better our work culture will be  CHAPTER 3  Having Real Conversations About  Diversity Inclusion and Belonging  WE ALL HAVE biases  Whether were conscious of them or not  they affect our interactions with others how we make decisions and  our overall outlook on the future  In fact our brains are hardwired to  prefer certain things while feeling averse to others  This becomes an  issue when we dont consciously recognize our biases and preferences  Its essential to accept that everyone including you and me has biases  Once we accept this we can work on navigating what they are and  how to handle them  When the Unintended Still Hurts  Our viewpoints are based on a number of factors including but  not limited to  • Race and Ethnicity  • Family history  • Gender  • Generation  • Life experiences  • Religion  • Sexual orientation  • Socioeconomic status  • Values  When we make statements or act without taking others  viewpoints and values into consideration we can offend and hurt  them  Although potentially subtle over time these statements or  actions—known as microaggressions—can do lasting damage by  destroying relationships by making people feel unwelcome and by  isolating them  Despite our best intentions the overall impact our  statements or actions make depends on how our audience perceives  them  Ill never forget a meeting several years ago with my peers and  superior  We were having a conversation about diversity in the  workplace  What it currently looked like what it would look like in  the future and how diversity would impact our organization and  beyond  My superior looked directly at me and said “I see the map of  Jerusalem all over your face ” I was stunned shocked and didnt know  what to say  The conversation moved on like nothing happened and  everyone around me stared waiting for me to say something  I just  looked down without speaking up and tried to forget it  As you can tell  by my mentioning it now its a moment that stuck with me  It still  affects me  Looking back I see this as a missed opportunity for me to  process my thoughts to have an open discussion or—at a minimum—  to speak one on one with this person on how these words made me  feel  I felt like I didnt have time to process my thoughts and decided it  was better not to address it  This subtle yet powerful statement made  me feel isolated insecure and vulnerable  And my situation is not  unique although yours might not be as transparent  HUMAN CONNECTION  I work for a mediumsized nonprofit with a very diverse staff  One  of our Caucasian employees found a resource to help other Caucasians  raise their awareness of internalized racism an issue we have dealt  with in our office  They emailed it to only the staff they perceived to  be Caucasian  Word quickly spread about the email and there were a range of  emotions  Some nonCaucasian employees felt supported while others  felt excluded  Other employees were upset because they were assumed  to be Caucasian when they were not  A few Caucasian employees felt  singled out as if receiving the email implied they needed this resource  As their manager I met one on one with the employee who  shared the information and explained the office feedback and the  importance of sharing this type of material with all staff and not just a  select few  I also personally sent a companywide email that included  the resource  Although this person was trying to be helpful they excluded  employees in the process and made naïve assumptions  This lack of  judgment led to an emergency meeting about inclusivity and affirmed  the need to continue to bring in outside support to work through our  microaggressive culture  ANONYMOUS  Being able to create a workplace free of microaggressions and  unintentional insults would be ideal although not realistically  achievable  However reaching a place where people feel comfortable  asking questions about our differences with candor and respect is  also exceptional  We should be able to have open conversations  without crossing lines or offending those around us—but that takes  time and can feel challenging and sometimes uncomfortable to  maneuver  As a workforce we need to become aware of our  unconscious biases and move forward to create a collaborative and  inclusive environment  If we dont set out time and create  opportunities for dialogue  • Office gossip starts and spreads  • Employees hold onto negative feelings about the people they work  with  • Unproductive confrontations occur  • Employees avoid colleagues  • Microaggressions continue and potentially increase due to lack of  understanding  As you approach this chapter try to keep an open mind as it will  be a little different from the others youll read in this book  Were  going to break down vocabulary share common and unintentionally  harmful phrases hear stories from employees who have felt  marginalized and walk through solutions and inclusive best practices  across all types of differences  As the diversity and inclusion landscape moves forward were no  longer just talking about outright racism or sexism in our workplaces  Its much more nuanced  Diversity and inclusion initiatives and  education are moving away from applying labels to everything this is  a training about race this is an initiative around gender and into an  inclusive space that encompasses all types of diversity  This chapter is not intended to spotlight one specific type of bias  or employee  Instead it frames our differences in race right alongside  our differences in religion life experiences and so on  The goal is to  become more selfaware of the language we use know when and how  to be an ally and find ways to have constructive conversations with  those who have unintentionally used hurtful language  Were all  individuals and identify with multiple elements that make us who we  are  Were not one dimensional and dont have one singular identity  A lot of this is not easy to talk about and the practices presented  will take time to practice vulnerability to execute and empathy to be  effective  Were all coming from different places in life  Its all about  using our unique voices to free our workforces of microaggressions  one conversation at a time  HUMAN CONNECTION  Whenever we encounter something we can experience it as  unpleasant negative and want to avoid or escape it or as pleasant  positive and crave more of it  This concept is called valence and it is  tied to two patterns of brain activity  In the Calm Clarity approach we  call them Brain 1 0 and Brain 2 0  Brain 1 0 is the fightorflight and  avoidance system  It is activated when you experience something  unpleasant or unsafe and you want to avoid it  You are then going to  associate that experience object or person with Brain 1 0 so it will  selfactivate in the future  This is called conditional learning  Similarly  Brain 2 0 activates when you experience something as positive and  pleasant  Then when you see it again your conditional learning  response is to approach it  Brain 1 0 and Brain 2 0 underlie bias  Your brain makes an  assumption based on previous experiences on whether or not to  approach or avoid certain people objects or experiences  Unconscious  bias happens when were not even aware that we have been  conditioned this way and we make decisions we believe are rational  that are actually based on preconditioning  In the 21st century were  saturated with media images and news stories that depict stereotypes  and when we go to social events where were exposed to other peoples  prejudices we can absorb them and unconsciously associate one  person with Brain 1 0 and another person with Brain 2 0  In addition our biological programs for outgroup aversion and  ingroup favoritism go back to our caveman days  In those times when  someone from a group saw a stranger the stranger was seen as  dangerous because the group member didnt know what that persons  intentions were  In general people who looked like you were safer  than people who didnt  As a result were actually hardwired to  activate Brain 1 0 when we meet people we perceive to be different  from us and Brain 2 0 when we meet people we perceive to be like us  The activation of Brain 1 0 toward outgroups causes us to hold people  in outgroups to higher standards  This means people in outgroups  have to work twice as hard for us to believe they are safe trustworthy  and reliable  In organizations when decisions are driven by Brain 1 0 and  Brain 2 0 at a subconscious level without awareness it can create  limiting patterns behaviors and suboptimal results  The key to  breaking these patterns is activating and strengthening a pattern of  brain activation we call Brain 3 0 which corresponds to the neural  networks for selfmastery and intrinsic motivation  We can activate  Brain 3 0 using simple practices such as visualizing what the highest  expression of who we are looks like and imagining what this higher  self would say and do in any challenging situation we find ourselves  in  Another practice is to set an intention to connect as human beings  who need to be seen and heard with compassion and imagine speaking  to the inner child in the other person  DUE QUACH CEO of Calm Clarity  Individualizing Inclusion  We each think act and experience life differently due to a variety  of factors including the ones we addressed earlier  Yet we still use the  phrase “treat people the way you want to be treated ” Although the  sentiment is well intentioned not everyone wants to be treated the  way we do  This is missing a major component the other persons  preference  When we adjust our mindset to “treat people the way they  want to be treated” were being more inclusive and creating  opportunities for open dialogue  So how can we find out the other persons preferences We have  to observe have conversations and build meaningful relationships  Embracing diversity helps us enhance creativity give voice to varying  backgrounds and provide opportunities for unique problem solving  This can also translate into extending a client base or transitioning  into new markets  According to McKinsey ethnically diverse  companies are 35 percent more likely and gender diverse companies  are 15 percent more likely to financially outperform their national  industry medians 1  HUMAN CONNECTION  If you want diversity you need to hire diverse people  If a  company is telling people they care about diversity and then you look  at their website their board of directors or their executive team and  dont visually see it the message will fall on deaf ears  Employees take  note of what their managers are doing just like kids do with their  parents  If employees see leadership embracing and exhibiting  microaggressive behaviors theyre likely to mimic it  If leaders say  they care about diversity they need to move past using buzz words  and actually show that they do starting with the hiring process  Companies need to make an effort to foster a culture of inclusion by  either promoting people who are passionate about diversity to help the  organization change or by bringing new people in  DR  JANICE ASARE Diversity and Inclusion Consultant and Professor  One of my clients was having issues with how their employees  communicated with one another  Although some tended to take a  more casual approach to language and would make jokes about their  identity others were not as amused  Phrases like “Im a redneck”  were being thrown around the office to describe their upbringing and  experience  Although the person identifying as a redneck saw no harm  in this phrase others within earshot were offended  So although the  phrase was not offensive to the person saying it their coworkers with  similar upbringings were uncomfortable with its use  Through ongoing  conversations the team was able to share why this phrase was  offensive and make an active effort to be more conscious of their  language choices  A definite shift was needed to “treat others the way  they want to be treated ” This was not something that happened  overnight and it took the courage and vulnerability of one person to  initiate the conversation  Heres a subtler and common example  As much as I appreciate  being acknowledged for doing good work I would be mortified to be  called out in a large meeting about my accomplishments  I would  prefer a oneonone acknowledgement  If I treat others the way I want  to be treated I wouldnt acknowledge them in a public forum rather I  would focus more on individual conversations  Although some may  like this approach others would not  Some employees may want the  whole organization to know what theyve done for the company and  would feel slighted if I didnt take the time to let others know about  their accomplishments  Now instead of assuming others want to be  treated the way I do I ask the employee “How do you like to receive  praise” This gives the individual the opportunity to clue me in to  their personal preferences and for me to follow suit  Navigating the Unfamiliar  Talking about our differences can be tricky and most of us are  uncomfortable with what we dont know  Lets say someone brings up  a term or phrase that youre unaware of or discusses a holiday or  tradition that youve not experienced  You could be thinking any  number of things like  • Should I already know this  • Should I just stay quiet and not say anything  • Should I pretend I already know and just smile and nod  • Can I ask this person about this  • If I do ask what should I say and how can I say it without offending  them or having them think Im ignorant  Staying quiet and avoiding asking questions can send the wrong  message and lead to more miscommunications down the road  Instead  of setting ourselves up for issues later on we should be having more  honest and open dialogue in a respectful way that shows were  interested in learning and understanding  It can be hard to ask these questions of someone you dont have a  close relationship with  Consider taking baby steps and asking a  colleague youre closer with or even a personal friend or mentor  Sometimes a quick Google search of the topic or question can give you  some insight and help you feel more comfortable with the direction of  your conversation  But before engaging in what could be a difficult  dialogue here are a few things to consider  Avoid a onesizefitsall mentality  No one wants to be the token  person representing a race ethnicity gender or disability  How one  person feels or views something doesnt equate to everyone else feeling  that way too  The goal of this conversation is to be more inclusive by  appreciating everyone as individuals  Try focusing on their personal  experiences  Ask permission  Before taking a deep dive into the conversation  make sure the person is comfortable having it  “Colleen Im interested  in hearing your perspective and was wondering if you would be  comfortable talking about it with me ” Explain that youre interested  in hearing about their personal experience and are not asking them to  represent anyone but themselves  “This is not something that I have  thought about before and I am wondering what your experience has  been like ”  If theyre not interested in discussing this topic with you drop the  issue and find alternative resources  Do not push someone to talk  about something if theyre not comfortable with it  If you find yourself  in this position here are some alternative resources you can use to  start your exploration  • Visit national organization websites i e  National Association for  Advancement of Colored People NAACP AntiDefamation League  ADL American Association of People with Disabilities AAPD  • Explore best practices through articles and research from professionals  i e  Society for Human Resource Management SHRM Association  for Talent Development ATD  • Take courses or watch talks by industry and research experts i e  LinkedIn Learning TED Coursera  • Attend events with a focus on inclusion and supporting the growth of  underrepresented communities i e  Hispanic Chamber of Commerce  Diversity and Inclusion conferences  Understand that this is not a public discussion  Starting a discussion  of this nature should be done privately and not in front of other  colleagues at a meeting or in the hallway  Dont put the other person  on the spot or call them out  Come with an open mind  Let them know that youre genuinely  interested in learning about their experiences and values  “Thank you  for taking the time to talk with me about this  I really appreciate your  sharing why genderneutral bathrooms are important to you  I am  interested in learning about this ”  Avoid stereotypes  Although this might be obvious on the surface  its important to not use derogatory language or stereotypes  If you  know certain words fall into this category—dont use them  If youre  unsure or completely unaware of whether something isnt OK to say  these conversations are crucial for you  When people are blind to the  fact that statements are indeed derogatory they continue to say them  and perpetuate a microaggressive culture  Have courage and be vulnerable  These conversations can be  difficult and showing your vulnerability is a big step  Be brave and  honest  Respect boundaries  If you notice that the other person is  uncomfortable with a question dont keep pushing for an answer  Respect that theyre taking the time to speak with you but might not  be comfortable with all of your questions  Remember this isnt an  interrogation its a conversation  HUMAN CONNECTION  When youre asking for days off or are being asked by an  employee for days off for religious reasons its important to find  mutual courage  No one likes to feel different risk rejection or ask for  accommodations they feel could risk a promotion  Anything that  makes us feel different is scary  As part of the ask be ready to educate  your supervisor  There is a presumption of knowledge but many  individuals are not aware of the significance of certain holidays and  dont understand the needs of those who celebrate them  Its important  to not just leave it as “I need to be out next Friday” but to take a few  moments to explain what this holiday and tradition is and why you  need the day off  You should also be ready for the questions about  why you celebrate a specific holiday or tradition if your supervisor  mentions they have a friendcolleagueacquaintance who does not  celebrate it in the same way  Responding “There is a diversity in  every world religion and people practice differently  This is how I  observe” would be an appropriate response  When we have these  open conversations it allows us to get a hopeful outcome  REV  CHARLES HOWARD PhD Chaplain at the University of  Pennsylvania  Now lets say youre on the other end and someone has asked you  to have a conversation  Here are some things to consider  You have the right to say no  If you dont feel comfortable with even  beginning the conversation you can politely decline the invitation  Youre not under any obligation to engage in dialogue that youre not  comfortable having  “I appreciate you asking me about this topic  however I dont feel comfortable discussing it  Thank you for  understanding ”  Choose the location  If a coworker has come to you to discuss  something more personal find a place where you feel comfortable  whether its in one of your offices a huddle room small meeting  room or when taking a walk outside  “I would be happy to talk with  you about this lets head to our huddle room to continue the  conversation ”  Avoid a onesizefitsall mentality  Its important to recognize that  your perspective is not the perspective of everyone  Youre not there to  act as a representative of an entire race religion or identity group  This helps to clear the air and understand the limitations of the  discussion  “I can share my experience with this but I just want you to  know that this is not reflective of everyone else within the  population ”  Be empathetic  It may have taken this person a lot of courage to  ask you this question and they may even be visibly uncomfortable  talking about it  They are sharing their vulnerability by revealing that  they dont know something and are asking you someone they trust  the question  End the conversation or take a break if necessary  You have the  right to end the conversation or to take a step away from it  If there  are things youre uncomfortable with let the other person know and  take the time you need for selfcare  “I need some time to think  through this question  Are you available for lunch next Thursday to  continue the conversation”  TIPS FOR ENGAGING IN UNFAMILIAR DIALOGUE  •  Ask for permission  •  Understand that this is not a public discussion  •  You have the right to say no  •  Be empathetic  •  Avoid a onesizefits all mentality  •  Come with an open mind  •  Avoid stereotypes  •  Have courage and be vulnerable  •  Respect boundaries  Get Comfortable with Being  Uncomfortable  Now lets shift gears  What happens when someone says  something or acts in a way that offends you Remember it doesnt  matter whether it was intentional or not  If it has bothered you your  feelings are real and should be valued  But knowing what to say and  how to say it is the next big step  One of the first things to think about is whether or not you want  to engage in the conversation in the first place  A way to help  determine this is to think about whether the interaction will get in the  way of your ability to work with the other person  If you believe it will its important to consider having this  conversation no matter how difficult it might be to start  For issues  like sexual harassment or blatant racism consider contacting your  supervisor or HR  If you believe its a misunderstanding however and  that having this conversation can diffuse the situation try these steps  Take some time to process  Before engaging in a conversation take  a moment to breathe and process the situation  Its not always best to  immediately address an issue  Whether its for a few minutes or a full  day be sure to give yourself some time before moving forward  If you have someone you trust like a mentor consider reaching  out to them to process the issue too but make sure the conversation  stays between the two of you  Being able to externally evaluate the  situation with someone else will keep you levelheaded and might help  provide a structure for your dialogue  Running this by someone else is  also a great baby step to gaining the courage to have the actual  conversation  You can even write out talking points and areas you  want to address and rehearse them in front of the mirror  Assume the best intentions  Assume the other person meant no harm  by what they said or did and that they were unaware of the impact of  their words or actions  If this is the case bringing this up with them is  a great opportunity to make them cognizant of a bias theyre  completely unaware they have  Helping them be aware of this could  benefit their future interactions with others  Also when we assume  everyone has the best intentions these conversations are easier to  have  “I assume you did not mean to be hurtful in any way but I want  to bring to your attention that I was offended by your comments ”  Provide a neutral location  Finding a neutral space where you and  your coworker are both comfortable will make a big difference  This could be a local coffee shop a huddle room or a work café  as opposed to your office  Set the tone  The key is to create an environment without  distractions  Show them that youre giving them your undivided  attention and are interested in having an open and honest  conversation  Try to incorporate these concepts  Acknowledge the value  By starting the dialogue with appreciation  you show that youre invested in both the conversation and the  relationship  “Thank you for taking the time to speak with me ”  Show empathy  We all come from different backgrounds and life  experiences and that impacts the way we see the world and the  people around us  Take a step back from what you think you know  and try to understand the situation from the other persons  perspective  Understand word choices  Avoid accusatory language that suggests  the other person intentionally did something wrong  Phrases to avoid  are things like “You meant to” or “You knew that wasnt appropriate ”  State the facts  To make sure youre both on the same page as to  what the conversation is about make sure you clearly establish the  who what and where of the situation that took place  This isnt a  game of Clue  You want everything to be out in the open so its clear  what you are talking about  Lay out the facts first  “At our meeting this  morning when I disagreed with your idea and made an alternative  suggestion you said I was being ‘dramatic’ and ‘high maintenance’ in  front of our whole team ”  Share your feelings and observations  Although you may know that  others feel similarly about the issue at hand this conversation is about  your feelings only—its not about generalizing for a group  Make sure  to use “I” statements instead of broadreaching comments  Only share  observable behaviors to avoid making assumptions  What did you see  or hear and how did it make you feel Focus on explaining your  feelings not what you think was intended by their actions  “When you  made these comments I felt uncomfortable and singled out ”  Offer suggestions for the future  As part of the conversation provide  suggestions for what they could do if this situation comes up again  “In  the future please refrain from using those terms ”  Show appreciation  Even though the other person said something  or performed an action that offended you take a moment to thank  them for having this conversation with you doing so goes along way  It extends not only a professional courtesy but opens the door to future  conversations  “Thank you for taking the time to talk with me about  this  I appreciate your willingness to avoid this language ”  Stay calm  Its possible the person youre speaking to wont react  positively—they might respond with anger or categorically refuse to  listen  Know that in this type of situation no good will come of trying  to push the person into a conversation  Assess their reaction and walk  away if you need to  Then talk to your supervisor or HR about how to  handle it from there  HUMAN CONNECTION  Early in my career as a resident director at a college I was the  only black woman on the staff  My supervisor consistently made  racially insensitive comments and jokes like “Here come ebony and  ivory” referring to me and a coworker  I felt uncomfortable but I  didnt know how to assert myself and address the situation  I knew the  comments were wrong and were contributing to a harmful and hurtful  environment without inclusion and community  But as a young  professional I let it slide for too long  It took me until the end of my first year to find the courage to tell  my boss how her comments remarks and jokes made me feel  After I  brought it to her attention she finally eased up and she explained  that she was unaware that they were offensive  She was using these  phrases without realizing their impact on me and our team  Sometimes people are genuinely unaware that they can come  across as prejudiced or offensive  These are people that you can have a  conversation with and they can see your point of view and make a  conscious effort to really change  Everybody deserves a safe and comfortable work environment  and that can only happen if we address the issues directly and have  open dialogue  DARLA STILL Rating Specialist Department of Veteran Affairs  If youre the one being asked to have a conversation here are  some things to think about  Listen  Actually listen to what the person is saying  If theyre  taking the time to have this conversation with you this situation really  affected them  You may not have realized that what you were saying  or doing was offensive so take this as a learning opportunity to listen  with the intention of understanding  Body language  Adjust your body so youre facing them and follow  their cues  If they sit you sit  If theyre standing you stand  Use head  nods to acknowledge that youre paying attention  These adjustments  show that youre giving them your undivided attention and value their  opinion  Validate  This doesnt mean youre necessarily agreeing with the  person but it does mean that you recognize their feelings and  experiences  In these situations its not about agreeing but  acknowledging “Thats so frustrating I can understand why youre  upset ”  Be vulnerable  Its OK to not know what to say or how to say it  and its easy to get defensive in these situations  Being vulnerable lets  the other person know that youre human and youre listening  “I am  not sure what to say  But I want you to know that I am listening to  what youre saying and I appreciate that we are having this  conversation ”  Accept responsibility  Whether it was intentional or not we need to  accept responsibility for our actions if we have any chance of moving  forward  This is not the time to question their story interrogate their  feelings or make a joke about it  Any of those routes can easily make  a person feel devalued and isolated  Its also not the time to provide a  critical response that puts the blame back on them  “Grace if you  werent so uptight this wouldnt be an issue ”  Instead try  image “I take full responsibility for making those comments  My  intention was not to offend you and I apologize for doing so ”  image “Thank you so much for your feedback I didnt even  realize that I did that  I apologize for my actions ”  image “Thank you for bringing this to my attention and I am  sorry for offending you  Can you tell me more about why this phrase is  offensive I want to make sure I understand so I dont repeat this in  the future ”  Offer followup and support  The goal of these difficult  conversations is not to sway people to one side or the other but to  come to a place of mutual respect  Sometimes we need to prioritize  understanding over being understood  This is not about completely  changing your perspective to match someone elses  Its about making  an active effort to understand the people you are working and  conversing with  If we want to be productive conversations should stay focused on  the impact and not the intent  There might not be an immediate  solution but offering to continue the conversation will lead you down  a path to finding one  With that said we need to toe the careful line of  finding a solution together versus offering unsought advice  Sometimes  someone just needs to vent and feel heard  Some great closings to your conversations can be  image “Im always here if you want to talk ”  image “Is there anything that I can do to help you”  image “I found our conversation very valuable and I would like  to keep the dialogue going  Would you be open to having lunch next  Thursday”  TIPS FOR ENGAGING IN DIFFICULT DIALOGUE  •  Take some time to process  •  Assume the best intentions  •  Provide a neutral location  •  State the facts  •  Share your feelings and observations  •  Be empathetic and vulnerable  •  Offer suggestions for the future  •  Show appreciation  •  Listen and be aware of body language  •  Accept responsibility and offer followup and support  Dont Be Afraid to Share Your Expertise  One of the more prevalent communication issues in the workplace  is privileged explaining  This is when either someone of perceived  power influence or dominant gender provides an explanation or  shares an idea in a patronizing or condescending tone  Ive worked in maledominated spaces where a womans idea was  often overlooked in favor of a male colleagues similar sometimes less  researched and thoughtout idea  Ive also been in situations in which  I trained colleagues and months later they approached me to train me  on the same “new” information they discovered  These types of micro  aggressions perpetuate a culture in which people not only dont feel  valued but are missing opportunities for diverse innovation and  collaboration  These types of microaggressions are not limited to just  gender biases they can be seen in any of the different viewpoints  noted at the start of this chapter  If youre experiencing the situations  weve already discussed or similar situations try using the  conversation methods discussed earlier to address this one on one with  the individual involved  You can also try these ideas to get your  opinions heard and show your expertise  Support your concepts  If youre sharing an idea give data and facts  that support your insights  If this is something youre intimately  familiar with try starting off with phrases like “In my experience” or  “When I ran a similar project in my previous role ”  Ask an insightful question  If someone is trying to show you up on a  topic youre an expert in ask them a specific question that only people  who are familiar with the content would know  This isnt to oneup  them but to show that you understand the language and are able to  keep up  Add something to the conversation  If youve been cut off from  finishing your idea or concept try “Let me finish my point” or “I have  something else to say ” Find a tone that is a little stern but not  aggressive  Repeat your idea  If someone stole your idea and is trying to play it  off as their own build on it  Repeat the idea and then say “heres  what I am thinking about ” And then share and show the strategy and  tactics behind the concept youve been working on  This will show that  this is something youre not only knowledgeable about but something  you have conceptualized beyond this meeting  Theres no doubt that this is not an easy thing to do  Starting these  conversations is no small feat and its equally difficult being on the  receiving end finding out that youve offended someone  But people  cant apologize or change their behavior if they dont even know it has  been a problem  As hard as it may be it is our individual  responsibility to address these issues if we want things to change  Remember these suggestions are things to think about and mull  over before having a conversation but you cant predict what people  are going to say or where exactly the discussion will go  There is no  script—dialogue is fluid and changes  Start by processing your  thoughts and getting support and then practice if youre not ready to  take the leap right away  HUMAN CONNECTION  I am a petite Asian woman who grew up in New York since I was  one  I went to an Ivy League school and I have my PhD in higher  education  During my second week at my new job I took the bus to  campus  As soon as I walked onto the bus an older Caucasian man  greeted me with ni hao  This was unnecessary—I speak excellent  English  I dont care what his reason was—it was offensive  I knew this  horrible moment would come at some point in this new place  It  always does  I just didnt realize itd come quite so soon  I walked into my office looking just a little tired and just a little  sad  One of my colleagues asked me what happened  I told her and she  looked at me with sad eyes and said “Im so sorry that happened to  you  There are some people around here who are just ignorant  Im sad  that your day had to start out this way  Do you need anything” I  talked to her for a while sharing my frustration at feeling distanced  and bothered—constantly having to answer the “Where are you  from” “No I mean where are your parents from” “No I mean  whats your heritage” “What are you” “No I mean whats your  nationality” “No I mean whats your culture” questions  She looked  at me with sad eyes and listened  I had a meeting with another one of my colleagues later in the  day  I told her the same story and she looked at me with a blank stare  and said “Im really surprised that happened to you  That sort of thing  just doesnt happen here ” I looked at her somewhat incredulously and  said “Well it did  It just happened  And he got off the bus when I did  which means he works on campus  So it does happen here ” We didnt  say anything more  Thinking back I couldve shared more stories to  frame that one experience but I didnt know my colleague or work  environment very well and I simply didnt have the energy in the  moment  If you want to engage in more inclusive conversations you have  to listen and affirm others and their experiences especially when they  tell you about the challenging ones  Its hard enough for them to open  up and share dont make it even harder by questioning the legitimacy  of their stories  DR  HOI NING NGAI Higher Education Administrator  Whats an Ally and How Can I Be One  Lets say you observe something that doesnt sit right with you or  you believe a certain group is not being treated fairly  This might  motivate you to become an ally  Just to be clear an ally isnt someone  who stays neutral its someone who makes a choice to get involved  and actively show support  Standing up for someone or a group of  people who feel marginalized is a good thing   if you go about it in  the right way  But when we take charge make assumptions and ask  for accommodations for a certain population that we dont identify  with this can actually do more harm than good  Lets first talk about this delicate line and when it gets crossed  In  one of my previous positions a coworker of mine was out for several  weeks and came back to work with a cane and a minor limp  He was  on the operations side of the office and had responsibilities that often  required lifting heavier boxes in the supply closet setting up for  events and tidying up the kitchen area  I noticed he was struggling  using two hands while holding the cane and a large box and I stopped  what I was doing to help  The next day I came into the office and  started talking with his supervisor about things we could do to help  make the job more accessible for him until he was healed  Well boy  was I wrong to do that  I completely overstepped and my coworker  was furious  I was trying to be his ally without asking if he wanted  one or even what he might need  When I discussed this with my coworker he explained he was still  capable of doing his job within its normal time frame and needed to  build up the strength to get back to his regular pace  He wanted to  prove to himself and the company that he would not be limited in any  way  Although he appreciated my help he wanted to be a part of the  conversation as to what type of help would work best for the different  stages in his recovery  After I accepted responsibility and apologized  we were able to heal our relationship over time  In another situation one of my coworkers noticed I was struggling  to reach my newly moved mailbox height is not one of my strengths  I was on my tiptoes and was about the climb up a small shelf to grab  my mail when she asked if I needed any help  I gladly accepted as I  knew my accidentprone self would most likely fall in the process  The  next day she came up to me and asked if this was something that  occurred often and if I wanted her support to speak to the office  manager to rearrange the mailboxes along with other hardtoreach  supplies in higher cabinets  Not only did I appreciate my colleagues  support but as an ally she asked before moving forward  Instead of  making an assumption she wanted to know what I would need and if I  wanted her to advocate for me  I asked if she could support me in  moving the mailboxes but said that I was OK with the office supplies  location as there was a small step stool nearby  Although this gesture  may seem small this made a huge impact in the way I worked and  our relationship grew as result  Allies are not expected to fix the problem but they are there to  offer their support in working toward a solution or simply to offer  their empathy  An ally is a person of one social identity group who  stands up in support of members of another group usually a  nondominant group  Allies are critical to improving diversity  inclusion and belonging in organizations  If you consider yourself an  ally or are interested in being one here are a few things to keep in  mind  Recognize your privilege  Privilege doesnt mean that youve never  had to struggle for something or that you have tons of money that you  dont know what to do with  Its the freedom that youve experienced  to not have to think about how others will treat you in certain  situations just because of who you are  For example because I am  cisgender defined in the glossary at the end of this chapter I dont  personally need to think about which public restroom I choose since  my outward appearance my pronouns she her hers and my  identity match one of the binary choices  For many other people  however this is not the case  To put it another way many of us experience tunnel vision  We can  focus on whats in front us while not even knowing what exists on  either side because were not experiencing it  This is not because were  not concerned its just that we dont experience everything that other  people experience  Before we can be allies we need to understand  how our privilege can impact our perspectives and try to understand  what other people are going through  HUMAN CONNECTION  I had a great interaction with a Kindergarten class I visited for  story time  I introduced myself as Mr  Coffey and a little kid raised  their hand and asked “Are you a boy or a girl” And I just said “Im a  boy thanks for asking” and the child said “Thanks Are we going to  read that book you have Because I like that book”  I think we can learn a lot from kids and how they approach these  questions  Although its not always appropriate to ask someone so  directly I really appreciate and respect how accepting young kids are  In a group setting at work Ive volunteered my pronoun first and  then asked others to share theirs  Ive been in situations where Ive  been uncomfortably singled out by a group leader while the rest of  the group just let their pronouns and identity speak for themselves  If  were going to ask one person its important to ask everyone else in  the room  In a oneonone setting its a chance to be more casual  “Im  name I go by pronouns how about you” This gives the other  person the chance to share if they choose  Once you know someones pronoun remember it  Practice it in a  mirror if you have to  Dont gossip or speculate even if the pronouns  sound weird or wrong  Its important to believe people when they tell  you who they are  RED COFFEY Childrens Librarian  Support dont lead  As an ally its essential to listen in order to  understand what the other person or group needs before you try to  “help ” As I mentioned earlier I moved too quickly without  understanding what my injured coworker needed or didnt need and  didnt give him a voice to share if he wanted support  Remember you  havent lived the life this person has and its important to learn and  observe not assume  Ask questions about their needs and listen to what theyre saying  with the goal of being able to summarize and confirm  Try using this  statement to kick off your summarization  image “What I am hearing is  ”  At the end of your summary try this phrase to bring it together  and confirm the emotion they are going through  image “And youre feeling  ”  Show up when the cameras arent flashing  If you want to support  someone or a specific population show up when no ones looking  Its  not about being seen by the bigwigs but about the people youre  supporting  Showing up for a major event that the higherups will be  at is one thing but it can be more effective to attend a small lunch  andlearn put together by an interest group  These types of smaller  actions will help you gain credibility and trust within a community  Support diversity and inclusion initiatives  Many organizations have  diversity and inclusion initiatives and programming that focus on  different genders generations sexual orientations or races and  ethnicities  These are usually open to not only people who identify  with that group but to allies who want to support their missions  By  attending events and meetings and by sharing information you learn  with others you can spread their messaging and get others involved as  well  An example of a way to be supportive is to be more inclusive  with the holiday decorations that are displayed in the office  Think  tree menorah kinara and any other decor that employees use to  acknowledge holidays they celebrate  HUMAN CONNECTION  As the Associate Director of Corporate Relations at Temple  University School of Tourism and Hospitality Management I was  tasked with gaining access opportunities and engagement to  professional organizations  At the time it was a new school and it was  difficult to compete in a crowded field  The traditional roadmap was  to attend and exhibit at conferences but that was challenging with a  small budget an unknown brand and limited staff  I had to take a creative and productive approach by aligning the  school with a commitment to multiculturalism  I then became engaged  and supportive of diverse communities  I recall my first Hispanic Hotel Owners Conference  I had  tremendous anxiety about whether I would be able to successfully  communicate and as a result I ended up misjudging the attendees  The experience was nothing like I imagined not only was it enjoyable  and informative but I also made great connections  I was disappointed  in myself and vowed to never make assumptions about others again  Through the years Ive learned that in order to be an ally its  important to make a conscious decision to put yourself in situations in  which you will meet people of other cultures  This gives you the  opportunity to ask questions and examine your own biases  Through  these conversations you can notice differences in communication  styles and values  You may make a mistake along the way but its  important to take the risk to start the conversation  GREG DESHIELDS Executive Director of PHL Diversity  TIPS FOR BEING AN ALLY  •  Recognize your privilege  •  Support dont lead  •  Show up when the cameras arent flashing  •  Support diversity and inclusion initiatives  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Make no mistake that talking about these issues can be difficult  and even emotional  But its crucial for us as individuals to understand  one another and come to a place where we can appreciate our  differences  If we keep sweeping these issues under the rug were  going to increase disengagement and push more and more people  away from us and our company  We all have the opportunity to set an  inclusive tone and be an ally  Understanding that we all have different  values and experiences is the first step but we have to show support  and engage in uncomfortable conversations to move ourselves and our  organizations forward  Now that youve read this chapter take the time to read the  following glossary of terms compiled from similar lists from the United  States Census Bureau the Office of Multicultural Affairs at University  of Massachusetts Lowell the Office of Diversity Inclusion Equity and  Community Engagement at The George Washington University The  Avarna Group and Scripps College  Knowing terms can be helpful not  only as you read the remainder of the text but also as you discuss  these nuanced topics at your organization or elsewhere  This is not a  comprehensive list and there will always be new terms and  identifications but this is a solid start  Glossary of Terms  Ally A person of one social identity group who stands up in  support of members of another group typically a member of  dominant group stands beside members of a targeted group e g  a  male arguing for equal pay for women 2  Bias Prejudice an inclination or preference especially one that  interferes with impartial judgment 3  Cisgender Someone who feels

for a person to do  activities such as walking climbing stairs dressing bathing learning  or remembering  This condition can also impede a person from being  able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job or business 7  Discrimination Actions based on conscious or unconscious  prejudice that favor one group over others in the provision of goods  services or opportunities 8  Diversity The concept of diversity encompasses acceptance and  respect  It means understanding that each individual is unique and  recognizing our individual differences  These can be along the  dimensions of race ethnicity gender sexual orientation socio  economic status age physical abilities religious beliefs political  beliefs or other ideologies  It is the exploration of these differences in  a safe

influenced by our  background cultural environment and personal experiences 28  PART II  Communication Styles Matter  CHAPTER 4  Opening Communication Breaking  Down Silos  ONE OF THE BIGGEST SILOS in an organization is in job  functional areas  These silos are the spaces where all the members of a  team are doing the same type of work and as a result they sometimes  forget that other teams exist  Often in larger companies employees  from one team dont interact with employees from another unless they  need something  For example a team might keep to itself except when  theres an ask involved like project funding additional staff or  technology support  These silos become even more distinct when a company is spread  out on different floors or different sections of a building or when a  portion of the company works remotely  In such cases people dont  have as much of a chance of running into each other in the halls or at  the printer  As a result when a task needs input from other  departments employees in silos find themselves not knowing how or  who to ask to move forward  A team existing in a silo may have no  idea of the time or effort required for a process being done by another  team  Some employees might not even know that there are resources  or people available to help them outside of their silo—resulting in  wasted time and repeated efforts  In addition these silos can lead to  turf wars because employees dont know what other departments are  working on and find themselves battling for who should own a project  or have access to resources  Like many societies businesses tend to be siloed and segmented  This feeds our human need for structure and order  However if we  cant communicate with individuals in the next department over what  are we missing out on What vital information are we missing that  could help us stand out as leaders employees and an organization  Lets say you work in sales for a company that designs and  manufactures equipment  How often are you talking to the people who  —you know—actually manufacture the equipment The ones who  work the floor to build it and who could probably explain its  innerworkings in their sleep Or what about the customer service reps  on the frontlines answering the phone calls and complaints from  current and prospective customers Theyre on the daily pulse of what  is making customers happy and not so happy  If we dont ask them for  their feedback and listen when they give it how will we ever know  what were leaving out of the big picture  This type of disconnect is happening across industries whether  youre selling equipment or treating a patient  And these divisions  arent just happening by department  The Silo Effect  During the interview process for a role in higher education I was  given the opportunity to meet with several teams to identify if I would  be a good fit for the organization  They each shared the exciting  projects and events they were working on and what was coming down  the pike  I noticed that a few of the events they were mentioning were  similar in purpose and were taking place on the same day and time  They were essentially competing with one another to get the same  students at separate events  It became clear to me that not only did the  departments not work together to meet their organizations larger  goals but they were also unaware that they were duplicating efforts  After noticing the ongoing overlap in these conversations I  started to ask questions about working across departments  “Can you  share examples of when various departments worked together to  achieve a goal” “What is your biggest challenge working in a siloed  organization” “How do you identify what department is tasked with a  specific part or entirety of a project” “How often do your departments  get together to discuss what youre working on and how you can  support one another” I never thought I would see such confused faces  after what I thought were simple questions about working together  While listening to their answers I was imagining money being  wasted employee workloads overextending and a turf war about to  explode  If I was hired I knew one of my biggest goals was going to be  to try to open the lines of communication within the organization  For  this organization to survive and thrive they had to work together  After I was offered and accepted the job I took a step back to identify  the landscape before making any of the moves that we talk about in  this chapter  In a new job its important to give it some time and lots  of thought rather than coming in hot with a big list of changes  If you also find yourself spotting a lack of communication across  departments or teams during an interview take that into consideration  when deciding whether its an organization you want to work for  Although bringing people together is something I enjoy doing I  recognize its not everyones cup of tea  It can be hard work and  requires a nuanced approach  Take note if this is a red flag for you and  make your decisions accordingly  I believe that every department in an organization needs the  others to function whether the organization realizes it or not  Creating  strategic partnerships and shared space for ongoing conversations is  essential  However the time to start these conversations isnt after a  situation happens or a problem arises  Start talking before such a  situation even starts  Being proactive helps build trust and a culture of  service and it shifts the dialogue from “we need you to do something  for us” to “how can we work together for the best interest of the  organization” It also enhances collaboration while decreasing  duplicate efforts  HUMAN CONNECTION  Our human services nonprofit was very siloed and as part of our  effort we created opportunities for crosscollaboration  We established  a training steering committee and development delivery and learning  management system subgroups  These groups have representation  from all departments and meet monthly or quarterly  They discuss all  training issues and initiatives being developed to see if they can be  used in more than just one division  These efforts have made a huge difference for our organization  As  opposed to creating a policy training or initiative for only one  department were now able to implement programs that benefit the  entire organization  This way of organizing our business also gives a  voice to our frontline employees so they can share their ideas with  upperlevel leadership  Instead of creating a culture of “no” we  created a culture of “yes and” where ideas are now built on top of  other ideas  DREW ALBERT Manager of Culture and Development  Collaboration Move Past the Buzzword  Collaboration is a word that gets thrown around a lot and in some  cases it has lost its meaning due to overuse  We assume that if we tell  our supervisors were collaborating or share with our employees that  collaboration is important that were on the same page on what it  actually means  In some organizations even saying the words lets  collaborate leads to eyes rolling across the room  For some employees  this just sounds like “Heres more work ”  So lets start off by talking about what collaboration is and more  importantly what it isnt  Youll most likely see this word in one form  or another in your companys mission statement  It may also show up  as teamwork or partnership  In its essence business collaboration means  working with others to produce something  Its a twoway street where  all parties involved are sharing knowledge and actively participating  in the mutually beneficial relationship  Collaboration isnt when one  side does all the work and you both take credit or when you just  simply share information or push work onto someone else  True  collaboration is when both parties are invested and working together  But this is not something that can just happen on its own or in a  vacuum  It requires an understood company culture a defined system  and the appropriate resources and tools that encourage employees to  work together across departments  When collaboration works it not  only helps the companys bottom line but it also enhances morale  development among the staff and communication across functional  teams  Although some of the areas well talk about in this chapter fall  under collaboration its important not to use this as an umbrella term  any time people have a conversation across departments  When we  generalize it thats when we lose the essence or worse it starts  getting used as a guise for passing the buck  “Wow Im really not into  this project  Maybe I can ‘collaborate’ with Ted  ”  Instead were going to focus on how to open the lines of  communication in order to lead to real effective collaboration  This  approach can also lead to actively sharing information and creating a  better understanding of the roles and responsibilities of employees  HUMAN CONNECTION  team I once led a team with five direct reports with different roles and  responsibilities  They  had  varying  backgrounds  skills  personalities and years of experience  We worked together on several assignments including one to  introduce new operational reporting metrics to our organization  By  the time this assignment was initiated the team was already working  well together  Our team meetings were upbeat and conversation  typically spanned a mix of workoriented and lighthearted topics  e g  current events sharing of personal stories etc  It was never  forced or contrived but rather it came very naturally  When  disagreements arose during the assignment it was never personal  everyone listened openly and challenged each other to build their  understanding or resolve their disagreement  We had prior experience that our collective work products were  viewed very positively by our leadership and we knew that no one  person in our group had the answer  My team would constantly joke  that I actually knew the answer but would keep it to myself so that  they could come up with it on their own  In part this was true  But  this team thrived by arriving upon solutions—they did not want to be  told the answer because they enjoyed being creative  As a result their  work product was often far greater than anything I had personally  conceived  C  COFFEY VP of a Large Insurance Company  Lead and Communicate by Example  As with many things in an organization conscious support from  the top can create an organizational shift in how we view cross  department communication  If leaders are not only saying that they  value collaboration but are demonstrating it by working with other  departments real change can start to happen  That means that leaders  are proactively asking questions about other areas needs actively  listening to these concerns and working with one another to create a  solution  HUMAN CONNECTION  One way the technology landscape has changed is through  “freemium” plans offered by companies like Slack and Box  With these  free plan options to choose from employees who are not the IT  decision makers are given the opportunity to select and use the  technology that works best for them  Were in a time when the people with the problem can be the ones  making the decision  This can easily be done on a teambyteam basis  If youre in a 2000person company your 20person department can  opt for these solutions to internally share documents  Employees can and will make technology decisions without IT  And ultimately any problems with their technology will ultimately  become ITs problem anyway  So its important for IT departments to  make sure theyre staying on the pulse of what their employees want  and are communicating openly with them about their needs  Why not  work with them to provide solutions up front than work backward  after problems start happening  JUAN VASQUEZ VP of Engineering at Modsy  With all that said willing leaders are not always enough  Employees often dont share information because they  • Lack the time  • Like being the expert or goto person and want to ensure job security  • Are not rewarded for doing so  • Were never asked  A culture that values communication across teams needs to  debunk these excuses and provide support and resources  Lets tackle a  few ways that leaders can start to bring people together from different  departments  Collaborate Then Compensate  As were talking about the importance of working across  departments it can be hard to see how this might actually work or  why employees would even try  We tend to set up recognition reward  systems  compensation  and  promotions  based  on  individual  performance  This can be viewed as in direct conflict with the  collaborative culture were trying to establish  In most companies  performance reviews are typically about how we performed as  individuals during the review period and not about how our team or  group of teams did  If your organization has a formal review where youre ranking  competencies consider adding crossdepartment collaboration to the  list  How did they help another team move forward What was their  contribution to the success of the group If its something employees  are evaluated on and their paycheck is tied to how well they perform  it can help push the needle forward  HUMAN CONNECTION  I like individuals who voice their opinion good bad or ugly  because at least you know they have a pulse  Its important to share it  in commentary written or verbal about policies initiatives  programs and things the company is doing  Feedback alone is a great  indication of engagement  When it happens in reviews its more  calculated and “checkthebox” and it is important to find ways to get  more informal feedback  We need to make sure were walking the walk  and gauge how people show up in a number of different ways  To do this we created voluntary engagement teams across  departments locations and functional areas where we actively  solicited feedback on leadership communication values and direction  and service initiatives  The teams suggestions led to the CEO having  breakfast with another department every 30–45 days without  management present to encourage more candid conversations  It also  led to the creation of our companys shared commitments  These  commitments were rolled out by the CEO during a kickoff event and  are now integrated into our performance reviews  Twenty percent of  the reviews focus on how employees live out their shared  commitments  They are also part of the companywide rewards and  recognition program displayed on office banners and on vinyl laptop  stickers  To ensure its success we have also asked managers to keep  these values front and center in team conversations  Although there is  risk in soliciting feedback it is risk worth taking  RHONA FROMM Vice President of Human Resources for Almo  Corporation  CrossTeam Conversations  Its important to be intentional and create spaces and  opportunities to understand what other departments are responsible  for and how their work impacts the overall success of your teams  projects organization and clients  In one of my previous higher education roles we proactively set  up a crossdepartment meeting  My department focused on the  academic side—helping students with courses and selecting their  major—and residence life oversaw where the students lived  Both of  our departments felt very disconnected from the other part of our  students lives and wanted to gain a better understanding of each  others roles to better assist our undergraduates  We also worked  across a very large campus and rarely if ever saw each other  To combat this we held a meeting with both teams twice a year  where we focused on updates upcoming deadlines and things to look  out for  In between these meetings a representative from both  departments would attend the other departments monthly meeting  and report back to their team  This gave all of us the opportunity to  understand the academic cycle of events and helped us find better  ways to work with one another to support our students  It also helped  us establish who was responsible for specific tasks and gave everyone  a contact person from the other team  After the first joint meeting we  started to collaborate more  Instead of residence life creating one  program on choosing a major and our department creating another  we worked together to identify the common questions we were all  hearing and created one cohesive program  Consistency and established frequency are the keys to creating  this kind of crossdepartmental liaison system  Attending one or two  meetings from another functional area may give you some  information but it does not help build relationships or open the lines  of communication  It also does not give you a better grasp of the flow  of a project from beginning to end  By having a yearround  representative attend the residence life meetings we were able to  better understand their busy times and plan accordingly  Creating  spaces where you either attend other departments meetings or  establish a joint meeting can be the start to collaborating across teams  The goal is to create a space where teams have a mutual  understanding that youre there to support one another and not to start  a turf war  You can do this by asking strategic and clarifying questions  during these sessions like these  QUESTIONS  BENEFITS OF ASKING THE  QUESTION  “What initiatives or largescale projects  is your team working on right now”  This will help you see if there is  overlap in the work youre doing  and can be a primer for a larger  discussion on how best to work  together  “Are there any upcoming deadlines we  should be aware of We want to make  sure were being respectful of your  workloads ”  By asking this question you can  better space out your requests  and understand why it may take  longer for a response at different  times of the month or year  “As were looking forward to next  quarter is there anything that my team  can do to support your team”  This helps you gauge not only  what is coming up but it also  shows youre a team player and  are interested in working and  supporting their team  “Have there been any issues lately  where you were not made aware of who  to contact from our department I want  to make sure youre not put in a position  where you dont know who to reach out  to with questions ”  This shows that you want to be  transparent  with  the  responsibilities of your team to  ensure their team is successful  Roles Responsibilities Transparency  Have you ever had a question and didnt know who to ask Its  hard to be collaborative if you dont even know what other people in  your organization are responsible for  When you dont work directly  with other departments or areas within your company it can be  difficult to figure out who does what  Titles are usually vague and  dont give descriptions about the specifics of someones day to day  As a manager you might know what each of your employees  does but perhaps you have not made it a point to share their specific  roles with the larger group  And although its great that you know if  everyone isnt on the same page it can lead to confusion and  headaches  “Wait so if Lonnie doesnt know who do I ask now  Brianne Doreen Both” This is especially important if you manage  more than one team that does not interact on a daily basis but only  comes together for projectbased work  We need to be more transparent about our roles and  responsibilities  When we share what we oversee tasks we complete  resources we provide and what institutional knowledge we bring to  the table it makes life easier for everyone involved  Without that kind  of information sharing there is serious risk of duplicating efforts and  longer lead times to get answers  “There have been so many moving  parts lately and I wanted to take a few moments with our team to  share what Im working on right now whats coming down the line  and what information other departments come to me for  Im hoping  this will help if someone from another department reaches out and  youre not sure who does what ”  Clarity Is a Good Thing  Having a clear sense of what is expected of each employee is a  win for everyone  For example Tanya might ask Justin to order office  supplies while Julie asks Ethan for the same thing  If Justin and Ethan  arent working together and Tanya and Julie dont clarify whos going  to ask for what youve now purchased twice as many supplies as you  need  And youve also spent twice as much time researching the best  price and placing the order  This is a simple example and it will not  solve all overlap issues but if everyone knows that Ethan orders the  supplies and Tanya does the inventory Julie knows she doesnt have  to worry about it  And youve increased your efficiency  So how do you start hashing out all this clarity Lets start by  asking individual employees  Yes we may have the job description  they were hired under but this may not be reflective of what theyre  actually doing in their job  So go to the source  Remember though—if youre asking people to clarify their role  its also important to provide them with context along with your  request  Simply saying “Ethan please send me a list of your job  responsibilities” might send Ethan into a panic  “Am I doing  something wrong Do they think I dont do enough Am I getting  fired” If youre the one asking for this information put the person at  ease—share why you need it and that you value their work  “Were  putting together a company list with all employees and their roles and  responsibilities  Weve received feedback that employees want to know  who to reach out to for specific questions and our hope is this fluid  directory will be the start to this solution  We recognize the value of  your role here and want to provide everyone with a resource of  contacts  to  save  you  time  and  potential  frustration  when  troubleshooting problems and working through projects ”  Some employees might be afraid to share what they do  They  might feel like theyre being pressured or put on the spot  They can  feel like they are being accused as if they need to justify what theyre  doing all day  If you encounter this with an employee continue to  reinforce the value they bring and how its important for you to share  this with their teammates  Give them the time they need to process  and respond  And if this reaction sounds like one you yourself might  have as an employee know that sharing what you do will help ensure  that the job is done right so that you dont have to recheck or redo  someone elses work  It will save you time in the long run  Dont let  your ego or fear of losing your job get in the way  HUMAN CONNECTION  In preparation for an employee taking a vacation or shortterm  leave I proactively schedule a oneonone meeting  During this  conversation I ask them what theyre working on the timeline for this  work and who else is involved in the process  This conversation is not  always easy  My employees feel ownership for their projects and are  confident they can complete the necessary tasks before they leave and  give direction for when theyre away  Because of this I can get  pushback on why I need this information in the first place  Through the years Ive learned to stress that I want to set them up  for success for when they return and my intention is to keep them  informed on the progress in their absence  I make it more about them  enjoying their time away and less about needing the information  From there we work together to create Google docs to share relevant  information and I copy them on all email communication when  theyre away  I make it clear that Im only copying them on emails so  they can be informed of the chain of dialogue and that I do not expect  them to respond  Our proactive conversations shared documents and  consistent communication has helped my employees pick up where  they left off as soon as they get back  They can follow the email string  and see where the project is without feeling completely lost  I also  preschedule a oneonone meeting upon their return to tie up any  loose ends  DEBBIE ROMAN Vice President of Membership and Community  Engagement for Girls Scouts of Greater New York  Use a Shared Tool to Map Out Roles  When you are putting all of this information on roles and  responsibilities together realize that it doesnt have to be some  complicated org chart or contain fancy graphics  It can be a simple list  of who does what a quick description of what they can help out with  and their contact information  Keep in mind that this information  should be easy to access updated frequently and available to the  entire organization  Try using a shared application or cloudbased platform that can  be accessed from anywhere by more than one person at a time  Encourage users and managers to review and update this information  on a consistent basis  You can even send monthly or quarterly  reminders and make it part of the task list for newly hired or  promoted roles  Having an outdated chart with people whove left the  company months ago might be worse than not having one at all  So it  is important to keep it fresh and treat it as a living document  Show Appreciation Across Departments  Once youve started to open the lines of communication across  areas its important to keep the momentum going  In order to do that  you have to share the value of working with one another  One of my favorite things to do at work or in my personal life is  to reach out to someones boss and let them know how awesome their  staff are  I call customer service lines for retail stores to rave about a  store clerk and I love to ring those fun “thank you” bells after  checking out with an awesome employee  At work Im always sure to  email the supervisors of my collaborators from other departments and  give them a specific example of how this person went out of their way  to help me and my team  Too often we spend too much time complaining and not enough  time thanking people  You never know if this will lead to a promotion  or recognition for this individual  Talk about a small way to make a  big difference in someones day Whether youre the leader of the  group or not you can take a moment to appreciate someone elses  contribution and if the praise is coming from another department it  can have even more of an impact  “Maria was such an asset on this  project  She spent time helping all of us understand your teams sales  cycle and has provided helpful suggestions to consider as we move to  a cloudbased platform ” The person youre reaching out to isnt your  boss and you have nothing to gain from showing appreciation  Youre  genuinely doing it to share how their work has positively impacted  your team  To take it one step further if you want to thank another team for  their collaboration on a project invite them to lunch host a happy  hour or give a gift card to those who went above and beyond  Above  all dont forget to say “thank you” either in person or through a note  And when I say note I dont mean an email  Im talking about an  actual handwritten note Unwrap that stationary your mom gave you  two birthdays ago and start using it  Send a note to an employee in another department who stayed  late working with your team or drop off a card to a peer who  answered when you called in a favor to help your team meet their  sales goals  Appreciate people and say thank you  Kind little gestures  like this can increase morale in the overall company and willingness to  work together in the future  If we dont see that were appreciated for  our work in other departments well go back to our silos and it will be  harder to get us back out  Collaborate Win Repeat  When your team has successfully collaborated with another team  shout it from the rooftops Let everyone at the next companywide  meeting see how you worked together  The positive outcomes may  include customer engagement decreased expenses and completing a  project ahead of schedule  When people can see increased profits  sales and a better customer experience collaboration becomes more  than just a buzzword it becomes a motivator for stepping up and  working together  And it shows what true collaboration really looks  like  So when your manager says “I think we should collaborate with  the marketing department on this project  Their experience in  engaging with our target customer can help us make more informed  decisions on our new chat platform” you can now envision what this  collaboration might look like  In sharing these successes you can also recognize high performers  and team players by name so people can become more familiar with  the positive impact they made for your group  Although you might be  involved in the project youre not apt to be familiar with everyones  input your other team members may have worked with someone else  more closely  When giving recognition to ensure you didnt miss  anyone in another area ask your team “What contributions from  other departments would you like to recognize”  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Bringing people together across departments requires intentional  effort and modeling from the top  Leaders need to be open to  collaboration to foster this culture in their teams  Leaders also need to  be able to provide an answer to “Whats in it for me” Employees need  to see the valueadd for this to work  Sharing knowledge is a good  thing and it leads to good results—better sales awesome products  new solutions  Collaboration is not just a buzzword coming down from  management it really is the way we need to be working today and  into our future  It will make our teams stronger and our individual  gains even more rewarding  CHAPTER 5  Making the Most of InPerson  Meetings  MEETINGS MEETINGS AND MORE MEETINGS  One thing that I  hear from clients regardless of what company or industry they  represent is how frustrated they are with the number of unproductive  meetings they are required to attend  Our natural default way of  disseminating information is to get people together—virtually or in  person  According to the Association for Psychological Science  employees are in an average of six hours of meetings per week 1 And  for managers its even more 23 per week Thats 300 hours for  employees and almost 1200 for managers a year Do you know how  much thats costing your company  Lets start by figuring out how much its costing one of your  employees with a salary of 50000 a year  • 500001853 number of hours worked per year assuming four  weeks of vacation and holidays2  26 98 per hour  • 26 98 × 6 number of hours per week in meetings × 48 weeks per  year  7771 total cost of salary spent in meetings  Now lets take a look at a manager who is making 75000 a year  • 750001853 hours number of hours worked per year assuming four  weeks of vacation and holidays 40 47 per hour  • 40 47 × 23 number of hours per week in meetings × 48 weeks per  year 44684 30 total cost of salary spent in meetings  To put this into perspective if youre having a onehour meeting  with seven people one manager and six employees with salaries  comparable to those just listed youre spending 202 35 per meeting  If you ask me thats a lot of money and time to spend on putting  people together just to share updates that could be sent via email  So  how do we make the best use of our time while still building  relationships and maintaining clear communication By being more  intentional and not having as many unnecessary meetings  Of course there are still going to be times and circumstances  when we need meetings  They help us gather authentic feedback  engage in powerful discussions and provide us with an opportunity to  get to know one another  The key is to make sure were maximizing  the limited time we have and that we are making sure people feel  valued and heard  Who Really Needs to Be There  One of the most important areas to think about is who you need  to invite  Its not about the quantity of people but the relevancy of  their role to whats up for discussion  Focus on having the appropriate  decision makers in the room  I cant tell you how many meetings Ive  been to where the right people werent there and we had to hold  additional inperson meetings because we didnt have the information  we needed to proceed  Or the meetings Ive attended where we talk  about future meetings where the right people will be there  Lets just  say there were always a lot of eye rolls frustrated faces and gossip  after those sit downs which was a symptom of employees being angry  at and losing trust in those leading these pointless conversations  Full disclosure Ive also scheduled meetings where I didnt want  to leave anyone out so I not only invited the key players but included  a lot of spectators  I was afraid people would be offended if they  werent invited even though their roles werent directly related to the  project we were working on  The key players were annoyed because  there were just too many voices in the room and the spectators felt  like it was a waste of their time  There can be a delicate tight rope to  walk to find the right balance of who should and shouldnt be sitting at  the table  Before you schedule any meeting  Think about the reason youre having one and what information you  want to share or discuss  Are you reviewing the whole project from start  to finish focusing on a certain issue or is it a general update  Identify the key players in this scenario and create your attendee list  As a general rule of thumb keep it to a maximum of two people per  department or area to avoid unnecessary representation  TO  NARROW  DOWN  THE  GROUP THESE PEOPLE SHOULD  HAVE ONE OR MORE OF THE  FOLLOWING ROLES  TO CLARIFY THEIR ROLE AND  NECESSITY ASK YOURSELF THESE  QUESTIONS  • Power or authority to make  decisions  • Ability to move things forward  • A specific area of expertise that  applies to this project  In addition the outcome  of this meeting has an impact  on them or their team  • If this person couldnt come  would I need to cancel the  meeting  • Who do I need in the room to get  results and move this project  forward  • Who has institutional knowledge  of this project and will bring  necessary value and experience  to this discussion  Send out the invitation to those youve solidified are vital  The  invitation should include  image Agenda  image Information you need from attendees prior to the meeting  with a due date  image Their role within the context of this meeting i e  sharing  department updates  image Prereading or review material i e  stats press release  image Note indicating a backup person is required if the  recipient cannot make it if applicable  Nolan  Our companys revenue meeting will be held on Thursday January 5  in Conference Room A  I have attached the agenda  Please feel free to  email me directly with additional items at least two days before the  meeting  Please bring your teams sales report and be prepared to discuss where  you are with meeting your yearend goals and what support you may need  from other departments to meet the goal  If youre not able to join this  meeting please let me know who will be representing your department in  your absence  Warm Regards  Sebastian  Remember that your attendees dont need to be present for the  whole meeting if all of the content doesnt apply to them  Consider  inviting them to the beginning to share their information and then  give them the option to leave early specifying this in your invitation  I  can promise you that they will greatly appreciate it  Identify Your Why  Before any meeting send out an agenda  Not five minutes before  the meeting starts but a good 48 to 72 hours ahead if possible  Give  the team the heads up about exactly what youre going to talk about  Then break the meeting into different sections noting the focus of  each agenda item  Information  sharing  Upcoming  projects  company  announcements  new  information or reminders  Feedback  When someone on the team has an idea they would like to  share and are looking for others to brainstorm and provide  input  Discussion  Anything that requires an open conversation  Giving everyone the heads up on not only what youre talking  about but also why you want to talk about it goes a long way  If you  find that your meeting is all information sharing cancel it Put all this  information in an email text singing telegram you name it—however  you want to share this info in a way that doesnt require putting  everyone in a room together  Very few people want to sit there and  listen to you talk about something they can easily read over at their  desks  A meeting that could have been an email is a recipe for  frustration  If theres a lot of brainstorming to be done give people the  opportunity to prebrainstorm  Not everyone can think on the spot  and they may feel threatened in a meeting if ideas dont come to them  easily without preparation  Give these prompts to folks in the agenda  beforehand so they can think about them internally before meeting  with the group  This is a great way to even the playing field for those  who think in different ways remember our strengths chapter and it  will result in more insightful feedback  You can also give specifics as to what type of feedback youre  looking for  Are you looking for alternative methods Potential  clients Timelines Procedures Give your attendees some time and  the information they need to be able to help you move your idea  forward  This goes for anyone in any role not just team leaders  If you  want feedback its more effective to ask for it  If you want people to  know whats going on in a meeting you need to give them ample time  to review the agenda  Team  I am looking forward to our meeting in two weeks  In preparation I  have attached our agenda and have noted the specific areas we will be  discussing  There is one particular item that I would like to spend a  significant amount of time on the Atlantis project  Please take some time  and come prepared with feedback based on your experience what you  would like to see changed and suggestions for improvement  Every member  of our team will have the chance to share their thoughts  I appreciate your  taking the time to review this in advance and look forward to learning from  your experiences  Regards  Saoirse  Structure Informal Conversations  An inperson meeting provides the space for people to hang out  and get to know one another but thats generally not the intended  purpose  Often we sit in meetings that have gone off track—ones in  which we have a hard time reigning in side conversations  Even in  small group settings a few people always seem to be in a completely  different conversation which leads to a missed opportunity for  productivity  Try to give everyone five to seven minutes at the end of the  meeting to hang out and catch up  Make sure this is something you  formally write in your agenda with “optional” next to it to give  people the out if they need to run to another meeting  For example  Informal catchup optional  This works especially well if attendees  dont get the chance to see each other often  If your meeting starts off with an informal party and continues  with sidebar conversations its going to be nearly impossible to get  anything done  By structuring the time so attendees can socialize at  the tail end of the meeting you can say “That sounds like such a fun  trip Kyle  Cant wait to chat about it more at our catchup at the end”  Communicate to your attendees “In an effort to stay on track and get  everyone out of the meeting on time with followup items were going  to add an optional informal discussion for the last seven minutes  This  means that we need to stay focused on the agenda for the rest of the  meeting ”  Ding Times Up  If your meetings tend to go off track or certain people take over  use a timer to keep track and bring the team to order  Assign a leader  to handle the timer and rotate the responsibility  “Team each week  someone will be in charge of making sure we stay focused and dont  stray from our conversation  I want to make sure were getting the  most out of meetings and sticking to our agenda  Well rotate this role  monthly ” This equalizes both the time individuals get to talk and the  responsibility of keeping things on track  You also can assign a specific amount of time for each agenda  item spending more time on the discussion and feedback section and  less on the information sharing  This layout should be noted  specifically on the agenda  For example Atlantis Project discussion 20  minutes  Get People Talking  I find that many people have amazing ideas to share but they just  dont feel that they are given the opportunity to share them  And  sometimes they might feel overshadowed by their peers  A great way  to put someone at ease and build their confidence is by sharing how  valuable they are to the conversation in your invitation  Liz  I would really value your input in our quarterly sales meeting this  month  Attached you will find the agenda as well as our projected sales  numbers  I think the group can really benefit from your expertise and  experience making cold calls  Regards  Marlene  Once the meeting starts the person who called the meeting is still  responsible for encouraging participation  After all you invited them  for a reason  Here are some ways to get people talking  Acknowledge participation  No matter what level of employee you  are its always important to acknowledge that you heard and  understood someones contribution and to use clarifying questions  when necessary  “Thats a great point Jan ” “Thanks for bringing that  up Andrew ” “Can you tell us more about that Mark” You dont have  to be leading the meeting to show appreciation for someone elses  input  When youre face to face you also have the unique advantage of  using nonverbal cues to interact with your team—like smiling  nodding or giving a sweet thumbs up  If youre virtual take note of  who has spoken and ask questions of those you havent heard from  Ask for feedback  If youre finding the conversation moving at a  snails pace try “Can I get everyones opinion on this” “Does anyone  have anything they would like to add” Or try bringing similar  viewpoints together and asking for additional input  “Piper and Na  mentioned having difficulty getting in touch with their customer last  week  Did anyone else have that issue” Its OK to have a few moments  of silence to let your team think over a question before you move on  to the next thought  The important part is to let them know that you  want to hear what they have to say  Know your audience  Its important to know who youre in a  meeting with and to adapt how you run it based on the personalities  involved  At times people may repeat the same information someone  else said whether its just to hear themselves talk or because they  didnt hear the other person cover it  In that situation dont be snarky  and avoid phrases like “Jamie said that 10 minutes ago werent you  listening” Snark is never good for productive meeting vibes  At other times it may look like people are just staring at you and  are not really paying attention  Try this “Everyone thanks for coming  I know its been a busy week as weve been trying to hit our deadline  I  promise as soon as we get through this content and discussion you can  leave  Im not going to keep you the whole hour ” Read the room and  act accordingly  Small groups  Who said that we have to stay as a one large group  for the whole meeting I say break the rules and break up the group  Some parts of the meeting can be “pair share” where people work in  pairs or small groups to discuss an idea and then later bring it back to  the larger group  Heres a way to get someone to talk about what they  discussed in a smaller group “Brian I overheard your thoughtful  insights while you were working with Zach  Can you tell us a little  more about your ideas on identifying a new target market I think it  will really benefit the group ”  Some of the attendees might be more comfortable sharing with a  peer than with the big group  Give them the space to do it  HUMAN CONNECTION  Our company just launched a twoyear leadership development  program  To prepare for it we brought together 35 employees from  our locations both in and outside of the United States  The staff ranged  from entrylevel and hourly to our most sophisticated PhD roles  We  divided them up into four diverse generations gender race  positions teams and asked them to use design thinking to create their  ideal twoyear leadership program  From there we were able to take  the best ideas from all four teams concepts to create our leadership  development program  There were some topics like conflict resolution that would never  have occurred to me to put on the list  But all four teams were  adamant about it not only being included but being offered as one of  the first sessions  Although the program is still new weve been  receiving positive feedback from our employees about its relevancy to  their roles and their willingness to recommend it to their colleagues  The programs success is in large part due to us taking the time to  involve our diverse staff and to ask them what they need to be  successful within our company  Also at the beginning of the class  when I tell participants that the course was designed by peers who  they admire they immediately buy in and pay attention  JAMIE LIBROT Director of Talent Management and Global Strengths  Leader  Gain insight into your behaviors and make adjustments  When youre  the one taking over a meeting youre probably not even aware  Start  to take note of how often youre sharing your opinion and the non  verbal cues of your peers before theyre about to speak  Do they move  around in their chairs Raise their hands Start to stand up When you  know someone else is about to talk hold onto your thoughts and give  them a chance to share  Similarly after you ask a question take a few  deep breaths before you either move on or provide insight  Dont jump  in without giving people the time to process what you just said  STRATEGIES TO INCREASE ENGAGEMENT IN  MEETINGS  •  Acknowledge participation  •  Ask for feedback  •  Know your audience  •  Form small groups  •  Gain insight into your behaviors and make adjustments  HUMAN CONNECTION  Being selfaware is really important and one of my top strengths is  communication  Several years ago a trusted colleague of mine  approached me and said “Heather you talk too much in meetings ” I  looked at her surprised and said “I feel like I have all these great ideas  that I want to share ” She said “You do but you talk too much in our  team meetings ”  I think that feedback is a gift and I felt fortunate that my  colleague cared enough about me to be honest  From then on she sat  across from me in meetings and we developed a signal  When I started  to monopolize the conversation she would casually move her hand  above her head  This helped me to become more aware of how much I  was actually speaking and stop as quickly as I could to give others an  opportunity to speak  I was then able to develop a strategy for navigating and  leveraging my communication talent to ensure it was productive  Now  before I go to meetings I give myself boundaries  I tell myself I can  talk three times so I better make them count or that I cannot speak  on a topic unless two other people have spoken to give them an  opportunity to share  Although Ive set these boundaries I dont feel  stifled  Its nice to hear my colleagues share their ideas and I am no  longer dominating the conversation  HEATHER Z  KAY Gallup Certified Strengths Coach  Be Smart About the “When”  Who loves a meeting first thing in the morning Although I have  not conducted an official survey I would imagine its pretty much no  one  Perhaps not the most earthshattering insight in this book but  someone out there needs to hear it A 900 a m  meeting on a Monday  might not be the best idea  Ive worked for people who Id wait until they had one cup—if not  two—of coffee before I would ever think of asking an important  question  Take stock of your attendees and when they are typically  awake and ready to go  You also want to consider the time of year  youre having the meeting  If this meeting spans various departments  and its during one departments busy season acknowledge it  Dont  ignore it “I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for coming  today and a special shout out to our sales team  I know this is an  extremely hectic time of year for you as youre trying to make your  yearend goals and I appreciate your taking the time to attend  Your  input on this project is extremely valuable ”  If you dont say anything people may think youre unaware of  whats going on in the organization and the workload of others  To get  a better pulse on the situation send out a survey to your immediate  team to identify the time of day that works best for everyone or have  an open conversation about what works best for all during your next  gathering  Listen to your teams needs and make them feel heard  Also consider alternate formats for meetings rather than the  standard onehour timeslot  Why not end when the content has been  covered Look at your agenda and gauge how long it will take to  review  Try 15 30 or even 45 minutes instead of defaulting to 60  This is when that “set a timer” tip comes in handy If the meeting is  scheduled for a full hour and youre finished in 50 minutes let  everyone go If you dont drag the conversation longer than it has to  be youll find that people are grateful to have been given10 extra  minutes in their day  Call Out the Elephant in the Room  There are going to be times when people just flat out dont want  to be at your meeting  Sorry its the hard truth People wont always  be gungho on everything no matter how important you think it is  Whether its because they pulled the short straw or were delegated this  project by their manager you want to call out the elephant in the  room  “I know that your plate is full right now and you were asked  last minute to fill in for John  Ive had the same thing happen to me  and its frustrating  What questions can I answer to make the best use  of your time” Then just wait for them to respond  This brings to light  the situation and puts that individual in the drivers seat to ask  questions and steer the conversation  This approach can also help  bring up issues that you didnt know existed and can be a great place  from which to start building trust with this member of the  organization  Leave with a Takeaway  At the end of every meeting—yes every single meeting—make a  call to action  What did the group talk about who is doing what and  who will follow up with whom and by when Be clear on whether  theyre following up with one person the whole group or a cohort  within the group  Without this it feels like the meeting didnt need to  happen in the first place  If youre in charge make sure youre bringing  all these pieces together or delegate to someone to take notes and  discuss followup  If youve noticed that your manager is not making this happen  take on this role and have a conversation with your boss about the  need for this closure  “Just to review what we talked about today  Jared youre going to reach out to Grant about the TPS report and  give our whole team an update next week at our meeting  John youre  going to talk to Stu about upgrading our teams computers and send  everyone in the room an email by Thursday on next steps  Did I miss  anything” Then get a verbal confirmation from the team before you  leave the room  This is especially important for inperson meetings  where people need to physically go out of their way to be there  You  want everyone to know what theyre responsible for and why they  spent that last hour or more in a room—and not feel like they need a  “I survived another meeting that could have been an email” sticker  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Taking time out of everyones busy day for a meeting might not be  your first choice of a wellspent afternoon  But if were going to build  authentic and meaningful relationships and if were going to build  communication between colleagues and teams meetings are  important  When done right If youre a person who likes to hear  yourself talk and do not give others a chance to speak stop If youve  been too nervous to voice an idea take a deep breath and try  If youve  never acknowledged a colleagues valuable contribution in a meeting  do it  Bring your inperson meetings to life so youre not dreading  them but rather looking forward to insightful conversations with  tangible takeaways  CHAPTER 6  Connecting a Virtual Workforce  THE  NINETOFIVE  BUTTINSEAT  culture  of  traditional  businesses is quickly going out the office or living room or coffee  shop   window  According to a 2018 study by Virgin Pulse and  Future Workplace remote work has increased by 115 percent over the  past decade with a third of global employees working remotely full  time or very often 1 As teams work across time zones and zip codes it  is more important than ever for them to learn to navigate manage  and create a community among employees  Virtual teams are the  present and future of work as companies look for employees based on  talents strengths and experience with less emphasis on their  geographical location  However even though this is the case it doesnt  mean were prepared to deal with potential pitfalls in this  environment  When you dont physically see or even have the chance to meet  the people you work with it can be hard to set goals spot disengaged  team members or even figure out how to work best together  Ive  spoken to many employees whove never even met their supervisor in  person  This makes it even more difficult to develop relationships get  noticed and bring people together  Whether youre a manager or an  employee on a geographically diverse team its important to play an  active role in creating an environment in which people have a  connection with each other  Its not always easy and it requires even  more flexibility and a conscious effort on everyones part to bridge the  geographical divide  Picture this youre a remote employee of an organization  A  small central office employs about five people and the rest of the  company works virtually like you  You have a fairly close relationship  with your team lead and have been emailing back and forth about a  client  The next day you send an email and receive this reply  Thank you for your email  I am out of the office on maternity leave  until January  If you need assistance before my return please contact Avery Smith  averymadeupemailaddress com or call 5551234567  If this is a nonurgent matter Ill reply to your email upon my return  You reread this email three times thinking that maybe you sent it  to the wrong person or you just dont yet have your normal amount of  caffeine in your system  Youve just found out via the “out of office”  message that the same person who youve been working with for the  past few years—and closely on this project—was not only expecting  but just had their baby  On top of that you should be reaching out to  someone you dont know in their absence  On the surface this email looks pleasant provides necessary  information for immediate contact and gives a timeframe for return  But for the people who werent in the small office having daily face  toface interactions this “announcement” came as quite a shock  This  is a true story from someone I interviewed for this book  The team  lead had a planned maternity leave over the course of several months  but somehow she didnt let her virtual team of 30 employees know  Now there are things that come up suddenly and there are things that  are very personal and not necessary to share  But for everything else  its important to give a headsup to the people you dont see on a daily  basis  Needless to say the employee whose story Im sharing was left  feeling like they werent part of the team  They felt unappreciated and  completely disconnected from others in the organization  Technology can be amazing  We have the power to be in a million  places at once connect with people from all over the globe and save  our company and ourselves thousands of dollars in time and travel  with just the click of a button  But what does this mean for building  authentic relationships with other members of the organization  The convenience of working from home in our pajamas or from a  coffee shop down the street means that we need to be more intentional  in creating a virtual environment where people feel heard valued and  appreciated  We dont want them to feel like theyre on a deserted  island and the last one to find out about a crucial event or change  Everyone regardless of level can play a part in creating these spaces  and enhancing their teams culture  First Impressions  If youre taking on a new role as manager or project lead or you  hired someone new for your team its a good idea to schedule an  initial “get to know you” video meeting  If youre the newly hired  employee ask your supervisor and fellow team members for oneon  one meetings  These introductory video meetings give you a chance to  get to know the people who work with and for you and can help you  establish rapport early on  HUMAN CONNECTION  When I first started to work from home I initiated video calls  with my boss every two weeks  We discussed how things were going  both on my side and theirs to ensure the transition went smoothly and  I was still meeting their expectations  My supervisor and I continue to  have open discussions about my longterm goals because I dont want  anything to be a surprise during my formal review  We both know that  its a twoway street and want to make sure that my lack of physical  presence in the office is not an excuse to not take on more challenging  work or continue to be a leader which are generally the two things  needed to be considered for a promotion  I also have chosen to travel  to the main office for departmentwide meetings and training sessions  to get both face time with my supervisor and to reconnect with my  colleagues  I have found that to not get lost in the virtual workspace  you have to make an active effort to communicate with your  supervisor and to keep them updated on your goals and progress of  assignments  Taking the time and making the extra effort to travel to  our main office also helps me show that I am serious about my role  and making a difference within the company  TAYLOR D  Certified Public Accountant  Give Them a Toolbox  One of the first steps to building a virtual team is to select the  appropriate tools  If were not using the most effective equipment  software or platforms were not giving ourselves the chance to build  meaningful relationships  But before we throw money at the latest  tech trend we need to establish what our organization and teams are  looking to accomplish now and in the future what types of  interactions would help make this happen and what other functions  would be helpful for increasing efficiency and productivity  I wont be listing the specific technologies by name as this  environment is constantly changing but there are some specific  functions you should consider when youre choosing the appropriate  communication tools for your organization  Youll almost always need  to be able to  • Access and work collaboratively on graphics and documents in real  time  • Communicate with your team through web video and audio  conferencing  • Find and schedule common meeting times  • Interact through a social network  • Manage projects and workflow through scheduling and task  assignments  • Share and store files and documents through a central secured portal  Host a Technology Training  After you or your organization has chosen the platforms youll  be using its essential for the team to understand how and when to use  it  Whether youre the one in the drivers seat or you bring in an  expert host a training that walks everyone through the platforms key  functions  Demonstrate where to click to search and share documents  how to start and end a video meeting and any other areas that are key  to your teams success  Share the best practices and rules for using  message boards with clear direction of their purpose “This board is  for sharing updates and for questions pertaining to technology roll  outs in the finance department ” Being as clear as possible about not  only how to use the technology but when and why is important  Give your employees an opportunity to test out the platform and  provide a contact for any questions that should arise after the session  so employees dont feel stranded when they cant access information  This may seem like common sense but to maximize its usage its  important to have everybody on the same page with this technology  from day one  Establish Communication Protocols  Organizations often stop technology training once people know  how to use it and they dont take time to establish best practices for  use  In order to have effective communication in geographically  dispersed teams employees need to know what buttons to push and—  most importantly—when  Having an open conversation with the group  to identify which technology should be used for which circumstances  can save a lot of frustration and create opportunities to enhance  productivity and build relationships  These conversations should  address which platform is best for  • Sharing and sending information  • Reviewing information  • Providing updates  • Asking indepth questions  • Providing quick answers  • Sharing new information  • Sending cat videos  Even more important than training teams on how to use the  technology is establishing team norms for people in varying locations  in order to provide all employees with a reference point they can use  to hold themselves and others accountable  Whether or not youre in a  leadership role you can bring up these areas for discussion  Work hours  Because people are working across all time zones  discuss what hours the team needs to be online and available  Is it  nine to five in their time zone the central offices zone or are other  hours more productive Once this is established have all employees  share their schedules with all members of the team through their  email signatures “out of office” messages and your internal instant  messaging system  How to be seen  How should employees show they are available for  messaging meetings or other communication Should they use the  color indications in the messaging platform green yellow or red  block off time on their calendars a combination of both or is there  another method preferred  Checkins  Its easy to get sucked in to your work and not always  check in with your team or supervisor about your progress  This can  cause frustration for your boss who may not know what youre  working on or for your coworkers if theyre waiting for you to  complete a step  Many organizations and project managers have  created “deliverable dashboards” to track progress and keep everyone  in the loop  These can be something as simple as a shared spreadsheet  or something more specific to your organization  You can also host  oneonone checkins but make sure youre clear on their frequency  weekly monthly or even daily  This is not about babysitting and its  not just about tracking progress on a project  Its also about  maintaining a strong relationship between employees and coworkers  HUMAN CONNECTION  Communication is the key to everything  Its important to make  sure my staff knows that Im hearing them and that theyre hearing me  Its a twoway street  Every Friday I have oneonone meetings with  my team leads who report directly to me  For my virtual team  members at our North Carolina office we use Skype and sometimes  phone  The team leads go over their own workload and if there are  any issues with any of their staff  As a group the team leads and I  meet biweekly to go over various initiatives and goals we have for the  month and goals we have for the year  We check in with work goals  and to see how things are going  I also have a monthly meeting with  the entire staff admins coordinators proposal development leads  and team leads  In addition to that we have a quarterly business  development inside and outside sales team meeting  I present on the  internal pieces including our key performance indicators KPIs the  director of business development presents all of the financial  information and KPIs for their team  I also go visit other offices once a  quarter virtual employees come to our main office for various  workshops and we have a yearly inperson conference for our whole  team  We physically see each other about three to four times a year  Everybody is informed on everything and this is something I strongly  believe in  I report directly to our companys vice president who also  believes in transparent and open communication  Its the foundation in  our department  KAREN SWANSON Proposal Development Group Manager Business  Development US at Almac Clinical Services  Team meetings  Will the team be doing virtual meetings once a  week or at another interval Or do only certain members have to  attend certain functions Who should a person contact if they cant  make a meeting due to an extenuating circumstance Make sure  everyone is clear on who needs to be where and when and youll  avoid missed connections and any “Wait what meeting” confusion  Creating a manual of these guidelines makes them more official  allows people to reference them in the future and makes it easier for  new employees to understand the virtual workforce expectations  Speaking of meetings thats another place where youll want to  create team norms  Although working virtually may be old hat for  some other employees might be new to this type of work  More  distractions and nuances can crop up for meetings in which people are  not in the same location  Here are some suggestions for virtual team  meeting guidelines  • Find a place thats free of background noise and outside distractions  Put your dog outside and maybe let the kids watch YouTube in  another room  • Use headphones  • Turn on your unavailable status  • Turn off sound notifications  • Avoid distractions  Act like youre in the room with everyone else and  put away your phone turn off your TV and dont work on another  project  • Speak clearly and remember to turn off your mute button before  speaking  • Use visual aids if possible  If youre on video look into the camera as much as possible when  speaking and listening  If youre finding yourself zoning out during virtual meetings try  these hacks  • Put a sticky note or photo under the camera so you remember to focus  there  • Close all other windows on your computer  • Remove all other devices from your desk  • Physically stand up when youre speaking  You also want to consider the timing of meetings especially if  youre working across time zones  Try having your weekly meetings at  the same time for one quarter then rotating them to a different time  for the next  You want to ensure that employees in one time zone  arent stuck always waking up early or staying up late to catch a  meeting during ninetofive hours in another part of the world  Create Opportunities for More  Engagement  With web conferencing discussion and messaging boards we  have so many options for starting and continuing conversations  The  key is to find new and innovative ways to keep people engaged  When  conducting meetings try  Setting up breakout rooms  These virtual rooms allow for small  group discussion within the larger meeting  The groups can meet for a  period of time to discuss a topic and then report back to the larger  group  Allowing people to share their screen  When someone is sharing  information allow them to display their screen so everyone can follow  along  This gives them ownership of material while allowing people to  further understand what theyre sharing  Creating a virtual notetaking space  Designate someone to take  notes during the meeting and have them visible  Without nonverbal  cues and with the potential for technology glitches you want to make  sure everyone is hearing the same information so they can ask  questions and chime in with ideas in real time  HUMAN CONNECTION  To increase participation on web conferencing platforms Ive  kicked off sessions with a poll  This immediately captures engagement  and then you can reflect on responses during the meeting  It helps  people stay engaged and included in the guided discussion  You can also use these platforms to mimic real life  Discussion  boards are a great way to engage on specific topics and often lead to  spin off conversations  Using the “” functionality to call on a person  or a group of people who may have more knowledge or experience can  help connect them in ways they are already using e g  Facebook  Instagram Twitter  These relationships may start virtually and lead to  direct persontoperson connections  KRISTEN TOPPING SHRMSCP  Talk Beyond Business  Schedules can get crazy and workloads pile up leaving days  weeks and even months between conversations with coworkers not in  the same office space  Finding opportunities to get your whole team  together may be difficult whereas finding spaces for smaller group  conversations may be more feasible  This works not just for work  specific conversations but also for more teambuilding and “get to  know you” sessions  Invite a colleague for an informal video call or  create a shared signup document for people to optin for an online  chat  You can also provide topics for discussion to give everyone a  starting point  Establishing a social relationship with coworkers—even  when its not in person—will help you feel more connected to the  organization and less like youre on a deserted island  Think about starting or being involved in a virtual social activity  Fitness  challenge  Sync your wearables to see who gets the most steps in a  week  Book club  Every month have a new person choose a book and then  gather online to talk about it  Virtual happy  hour  Grab a glass of wine beer or sparkling water and chat  away with your coworkers  Virtual lunches Order delivery or have your team members expense a  takeout meal to enjoy together  Try to Meet InPerson  In a virtual world where there is so much clutter its easy to get  distracted  We can easily text and get in a doodle or two all while  “paying attention” from behind a screen  And of course virtual  conversations can still have barriers  Being able to see nonverbal cues  is important  Finding an opportunity to be physically in the same place  is crucial whether it happens once a year at the company retreat  when its allhandsondeck during the busy season or on a more  frequent basis  No matter how hard we try nothing can replace that  inperson human connection  Although not every company or person  can always meet in person due to distance and cost here are some  ideas to make it a little easier  • If theres a central office where a few people you work with are  stationed ask for permission to travel once a quarter to have an in  person meeting  • Attend a professional development workshop conference training or  seminar close to corporate headquarters and work a day from that  office  • Host an inperson team retreat at a neutral location so all members can  meet one another  • Schedule your annual or quarterly review sessions in a central location  or travel to your employees headquarters  • If youre traveling and will be close to where one of your teammates or  employees lives ask to grab lunch  By making yourself available in person you can get a realtime  pulse on engagement and satisfaction  Its hard to see how people  interact with each other in a virtual space but in person you can see  who sits with whom who seems disengaged who is staring in space  and where the action is happening  Are people hanging out in the  break room and saying hi to each other when they pass in the halls  Or is everyones door shut and theirs heads are down focused on their  computers These are things you wont find on any fancy platform  And as an employee spending inperson time with your boss can  ensure they dont forget about you Getting some quality face time  with your supervisor can help you get a better gauge on your  performance areas for improvement and future with the company  You Are Your Word  Do what you say youre going to do Maybe this goes without  saying but your word is important especially on a virtual team  Its  essential to follow through on your commitments be on time to  meetings and keep others in the loop on what youre working on  Unlike working in an office you cant stop a coworker in the hallway  or pull them aside while theyre heating up their lunch to check on the  status of a project  Dont leave other people hanging or wondering if  youll ever get back to them  Honor your word and be communicative  Biannual CheckUps  Establishing a twiceayear checkup can help you gauge how  your team communicates  Just like being proactive with your health  by going to the doctor for your yearly physical these checkups will  give you the chance to improve the “health” of your virtual team  Without setting aside time to specifically talk about strategies best  practices and potential breakdowns you might be missing key  opportunities to enhance relationships and connections among your  team  A checkup can be as simple as a 60minute meeting that follows  a survey on the following information  • Most commonly used medium to share information email call face  toface virtual meeting  • Frequency of information sharing five times a day once a week etc  • Length of information sharing sessions 30 minutes one hour  • Attitude toward existing communication tools  • Suggestions for enhancement of sharing tools  The biannual meeting would not only be a review of the results  your team gathered but it would also be an open forum for providing  suggestions on new technology establishing new practices and airing  any virtual communication concerns or issues that have not been  previously addressed  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Working with people from across the globe can be difficult and  sometimes even feel a bit   unhuman  But its the reality of our  future workplace so we need to work on making it well a little more  human  It takes extra effort to establish rapport build relationships  and improve communication when were not seeing our colleagues in  person  If we dont make an active effort to get to know the people  who work with us well quickly feel isolated and disengaged  We all  have a voice and an opportunity to create the culture we want for our  virtual teams so embrace new ways to connect via technology and  with a little creativity  PART III  Change Is the Only Constant  CHAPTER 7  Breaking Through the Screen  Barrier  SO MUCH HAS CHANGED and will continue to change with  technology  But right now email remains a major form of  communication in our work culture  Email gives everyone the  opportunity to reach each other regardless of location whether theyre  in Baltimore or Brazil and it provides a means for correspondence  It  is the universal language of business correspondence across the world  Because of its ubiquity its easy to just hit “send” on an email  without taking the time to build a personal connection with the  recipient  We often use email to disseminate information or get  updates and leave our personalities out of the conversation  Sometimes  its hard to remember that theres an actual human on the other side of  that recipient name—especially when they wont answer  But our email doesnt just have to be a forum for the old “Just  checking in to see if you received my last message  ” You can also  use email to get to know colleagues who you might not see that often  You can use it as an opportunity to add something personal and let a  coworker know that you care  “Rachel congratulations on your baby  girl I just got the companywide announcement and shes adorable  How are you feeling” With just a few tweaks and a bit of care we can  enhance our professional relationships through email  Toxic Tones  “Sarah as Ive previously mentioned stop sending me cat videos ”  “Garrett just wondering Did you take my lunch from the fridge”  “Kyle not sure if you saw my last email or the one before that or  the one I sent you before that one  Actually do you ever check your  email”  Weve all done it  You know the snarky attitude that comes across  in your emails where youre annoyed that the person on the other end  isnt responding or just isnt paying attention  But being passive  aggressive can quickly destroy relationships  Here are some of the  worst phrases you can write if someone hasnt responded to your last  email  • “Not sure if you saw my last email”  • “Any update on this”  • “Sorry for the double email”  • “Reattaching for convenience”  • “Sorry to bother you but  ”  • “Just wondering”  • “Im not sure if my email ever made it to you as I havent heard back”  • “It appears you forgot to  ”  And here are some pretty bad ones when you think the other  person should already know the answer to the questions theyre  asking  • “Per our last email” The mother of all email snark  • “Per our conversation”  • “As discussed”  • “As previously stated”  • “First of all”  • “In case you missed it”  • “According to my records”  • “Please note”  But why are they bad and why should we stop using them  Because these phrases can often come across as accusatory and you  can almost see your mom waving her finger back and forth as you  read them  They set a poor tone for the email and can immediately  turn off your recipient  They are also unnecessary addons that serve  no positive value  Instead of using these phrases you can either copy  and paste a previous response or reframe or paraphrase your previous  answer and leave the “per my previous email” out of the equation  Emotion can be hard to get across in an email but the followup  phrases just listed can leave your colleagues feeling frustrated and  unmotivated to respond  And yes of course intentionally not  answering an email and letting it sit in their inbox is also passive  aggressive  But dont be the one to set that tone  Even phrases like  “sorry to bother you” or “reattaching for your convenience” which  are intended to sound polite usually have an underlying and  commonly understood meaning  Translation “I need an answer ” So  instead of beating around the bush in a “nice” way come out and ask  the question directly  To figure out how to replace these fauxpas phrases first  determine whether you want your recipient to provide you with  additional information or if you just need to know that they received  your email  This determines what your followup phrasing should be  If youre frustrated and know that youre going to sink into old habits  write out your email save it and then come back later and update it  after youve had a minute to cool down  Never email when youre  angry Here are some easy phrases to swap in for those passive  aggressive nonos  LOOKING FOR INFORMATION AND  FOLLOW UP  NO  ACTION  REQUIRED  CONFIRMATION REQUEST  • “Name I have some new information  I wanted to share with you that may  impact your feedback on my previous  email ” Give an update and share new  information then reference the  previous request  • “If I dont hear from you by date Im  going to move forward ”  • “Hi name can you please let me  know where you stand on x  I need to  follow up with person by date and  value your input ”  • “Hi name I just wanted to see if you  had input on x  I value your opinion  and would like to include it in my  communication with person ”  • “I wanted to check in to  see if you had any  questions regarding  ”  • “I wanted to follow up  with you to see if you  received my previous  email about x and if you  had any questions ”  • “Hi name do you have  any questions regarding  x”  • “Name this is just a  reminder about x  Please do not hesitate to  reach out if you have any  questions ”  Subject  Lines  “Response  Needed”  “Timely”  People will appreciate that youre being honest and direct—youre  getting to the root of what you need without all that surface language  Why Am I CCd on This  We receive so many emails each day that its easy for things to get  lost  And by so many I mean we receive 269 billion consumer and  business emails each day and this is expected to rise to 319 6 billion  in the next few years 1 The more we can do to cut down on the clutter  the better This includes not adding to it  I know sometimes sending  an email is just easier  You have something on your mind and you  want someone to know about it you need to send a file or youre  using it as a written record  One of the first conversations I have with my clients or teammates  is about how we can effectively communicate through email  This  wasnt something I did until I noticed that certain pieces of  information would become buried in email chains that some people  preferred to communicate in person or that we needed a consistent  method for sending updates on the status of projects  Having these  conversations now helps me set group norms and expectations  Here  are the questions Im sure to cover  • “When we send emails do you prefer them to be separated by subject  so you can track it that way Or do you prefer fewer longer emails  that cover a variety of topics”  • “What should we cover via email versus face to face or by other  means”  • “Are there certain types of emails you want to be ccd on”  • “What is the best way to let you know the results of a project I am  working on”  • “What is the expected response time for emails both internally and to  our external partners and clients”  • “If an internal email is not answered within our designated time  period how should we update the subject to indicate a followup  request Would writing ‘2nd request subject’ be appropriate”  • “How many backandforth email exchanges on the same topic are  acceptable before we make the conversation face to face”  If an email conversation has been going back and forth for a  while its easy to lose sight of its original intent especially when you  add on another recipient after the initial email  No one wants to scroll  through the entire conversation to figure out whats meant for them in  the bread crumbs of information “found below ”  Instead of just adding a cc or forwarding a thread try creating a  new thread and then copy and paste the vital information from the old  thread to the new one to get everyone on the same page  This extra  step of boiling things down to what your current recipients need to  know really shows that you value their time so theyre not sifting  through random content that doesnt make sense or apply to them  You can make things even simpler by summarizing using bullets  instead of paragraphs  Getting straight to the point and without all the  fluff makes your email easier to read digest and understand for your  recipients  This way youre not the reason someone is staring at their  inbox saying “Why am I even on this email”  Read and Respond  Reflect on the group communication norms your team came up  with at the beginning of the project and stick with them  If your group  decided that answering emails within 24 to 48 hours was important  then make a habit of following through in that time period  We all get  it—things happen—but make it a point to always follow up  If you  dont have the answers are waiting for something or are not ready to  make a full response just send a quick email update  “Thanks for the  information Kim  I am waiting to hear back from purchasing about  your question and will update you as soon as I have the most recent  information ” “Thank you for your email  I will review this and get  back to you by tomorrow afternoon ” You can also send a simple  “Received ” or “Got it ” depending on your relationship with the  recipient  Dont force people to have to reach back out to you for an  answer  You dont want to develop a reputation as someone who is not  responsive  And if you encourage followups when youre on the receiving  end let people know  One of my colleagues put out a clever disclaimer  during a team meeting “If I dont get back to you within 48 hours I  may have lost your email  Please email me again to make sure I get  back to you ” We all knew that if we didnt hear back from them in  two days it was time to follow up  Think Before You Send  Ill be the first to admit that Ive preemptively sent an email  I  breezed through it thought that everything was good to go hit send  and then bam   add was spelled ass  A quick run to my supervisor  cleared the air but my heart was pounding from the minute I noticed  the error  Ive also gotten recall requests from colleagues whove  realized that they sent something that wasnt work appropriate  By  that time we had already gotten it read it and then reread it to see  what the cause of such a fuss was  Just remember before you hit send  make sure youre sending it to the right personpeople that it has the  attachments you note in your message that it is free of any spelling or  grammatical errors and that it is work appropriate  Try using the  following checklist to keep on track  EMAIL CHECKLIST  •  Check for spelling and grammatical errors  •  Make sure “To” “CC” and “BCC” lines are accurate  •  Does the subject line appropriately reflect the email content  •  If noted confirm attachments referenced are included  •  Confirm the content is clear straightforward and easy to read  •  Make sure appropriate contact information is included  HUMAN CONNECTION  One of the biggest email communication errors I have observed  over the years is not checking on who is on the distribution list  I can  remember one case in particular when a vice president at ATT asked  her team for 360degree feedback  One of her direct reports a person  she brought with her from a previous position she held and a close  friend decided to provide her with some supportive yet judgmental  feedback  It would have been well received had he shared it with just her  However he didnt check the distribution list and it went out to  everyone on her team  It was not completely complimentary so there  were very hard feelings and a lot of anger  It took some time before  their relationship returned to its original level  This all could have  been avoided had he checked who the email was actually being sent  to  LORI ROSENTHAL Strategic Human Resources Partner  Set Email Expectations  We talk a lot about worklife balance and worklife integration  but we dont necessarily set the expectations around what that means  in terms of electronic communication  As a supervisor if you say that  people dont have to answer their email on off hours but then you  send emails during that time give your team the heads up that they  dont have to respond  Or just flat out dont send emails during of  hours  We have to practice what we preach  For the benefit of the team you work with make sure everyone  understands your offhour email tendencies and expectations  The best  way to make sure everyone is on the same page is to have a  conversation about it  “Team I know I send you emails on nights and  weekends  I am going to try to do a better job of waiting until normal  business hours to send them because I know many of you take the  time to answer them during your off hours and that is not my  expectation  I want you to enjoy your time with your family and  friends and not worry about what is sitting in your inbox ” Or “I tend  to send emails during off hours but I do not have the expectation that  you will respond  When something comes up I want to pass it along as  soon as I can so I do not leave you out of the loop ”  If youre not a supervisor and feel inundated with emails during  off hours speak to your manager about it  “Paula I wanted to touch  base about your expectations in terms of response time to emails  My  goal is to get back to people within 24 hours but sometimes you send  emails on nights and weekends  Is your intention for me to answer  them during that time or is the next business day appropriate” Or “I  notice that I get a lot of emails after the office closes and I dont have  work email set up on my personal phone  Is there an expectation that I  do so” However keep in mind that such conversations should be had  with a team as a whole so everyone is on the same page not just the  two people originally involved  At times information may need to be addressed during off hours  This could be for lastminute client changes a closing deadline or in  an emergency situation  Its important to establish a policy where the  manager or project lead provides a headsup to employees to ensure  they meet their expectations  This can be done in person too  “Jane I  know youre headed out for the weekend in a few hours but I still  havent heard from our client about the Tshirt orders  We need to get  the order in before Saturday at noon for it to ship on Tuesday  They  should be emailing me within the next few hours  Ill forward you their  request as soon as I have it for you to push the order through  Thanks  for handling this on such short notice ”  Its Not That Serious  Stop using the “high importance” feature if you dont need to I  get it everything we say and do is important but if its not actually  urgent youre going to turn people off and quickly lose the  opportunity to build a strong working relationship  You know the  story of the boy who cried wolf and when the wolf finally came  nobody cared right Same thing  When you actually need something  people wont pay attention if youre constantly putting everything on  high alert  Here are some things to think about before you hit that red  exclamation point  • Is the deadline within the next 24–48 hours  • Did a meeting scheduled for the same day get cancelled Is there a last  minute meeting that they need to attend  • Does this need to be a top priority because this response affects the  workprocess timeline of others  • Is there an actual emergency If its this one go beyond the email and  make a call or talk to someone in person  • Is there cake in the breakroom OK not really high importance–  worthy but save a piece for me  Think about if its timesensitive or if theres an important piece of  information that needs to be added to an agenda on an upcoming  meeting  If you honestly answered “yes” to one or more of these  questions its OK to send your email with high importance  If none of  these apply and you just want people to know something that you feel  is important—avoid unnecessary use of the button  You dont want to  dilute the actual importance of a future email  Change Up Your Signoff  One of the things Ive struggled with for years is how to end an  email  I used “Best” as the tried and true for years but it just never  seemed to give a personal touch  It always felt a little blah  Writing  something with a little flair can add an extra impression and give  people a little more of your personality  It can also lead to a higher  response rate  Here are some closings to spice up your emails  Go with the ones  that speak to your personality to the nature of your email and to the  intended recipient  You can also rotate your closing phrase so people  dont get the impression its just a generic signoff or part of a  signature  TONE  SIGNOFF  Neutral  • Cheers  • Take Care  • Warmly  • Best  Appreciative  • Many Thanks  • Thank You  • Warm Regards  • Warmest Regards  Formal but not stiff  • Regards  • Kind Regards  • Best Regards  Add a Headshot  An easy way to personalize your email is by adding a headshot to  your signature  In one of my previous roles our organization made the  conscious decision to change the email templates to accommodate a  photo for a more personalized feel  The organization held free  headshot sessions emailed us our photos and instructed us on how to  add it to our email signature and to other digital platforms  My organization realized that signatures with just names titles  and contact information didnt add much context to the person behind  the message  Having seen a photo also helps if youre meeting  someone for the first time and you can connect the name from their  email to the face that youre seeing  And it doesnt even have to be a  formal headshot  Something from the shoulders up smiling and taken  within the last decade will do the trick  A strong signature that informs a reader of the best and most  convenient ways to contact you should include  • Name  • Title  • Organization  • Contact information phoneemail  • Professional social channels if applicable  • Video or other timely content  Confused Just Ask  Lets say an email you receive doesnt have all the information  youre looking for or youre having trouble following an email that  seems to be going in a million different directions  Youre now in a  position in which you either have to ask some questions to clarify the  main points or spend some time raking through the clutter  Your  response email can set the tone for future conversations  Paraphrase  and then ask a direct question about your responsibilities “I want to  make sure I am understanding your question correctly and providing  you with accurate information  Would you like me to find the data for  calls made in March of 2019 and compare that data to numbers from  the previous year”  If possible an inperson or overthephone conversation may be  best  This helps avoid overloading email boxes and can keep the email  conversation on track  Add Something Personal  An easy way to not only share information but also to show that  you care is by asking a question about someones personal life—  something that they shared with you and you want to follow up on  This doesnt have to be in a separate email  Include a personal touch to  a workrelated email with a simple “I heard you adopted a dog how  is that going Do you have any pictures” “Congratulations on the  promotion  I know youve been working hard and Im really excited  for you” “Last time we talked you werent feeling well are you feeling  any better” Use the information that you have and ask a question to  check in to see how they are doing  Just make sure its just the two of  you on the email thread  A little human connection via email can go a  long way  It shows you were listening care and are interested in what  is going on in the other persons life  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Even though you cant physically see a person it doesnt mean  they dont exist  Another real person is always on the other side of that  “send” button  If someone isnt answering your emails in a timely  matter assume the best intentions and follow up  Nothing good ever  comes from being passive aggressive  By writing a small but  thoughtful question or by adding a photo in your signature you can  take your email to the next level and bring a human element to  something that doesnt always feel so personal  CHAPTER 8  Communicating with Intention—  Choosing a Medium  WITH SO MANY WAYS to interact it can be confusing to figure  out which medium will work best in each situation  Without taking a  step back to identify the most effective form of delivery your message  has the real possibility of not only getting lost but also being  completely forgotten  Marshall McLuhan in his book Understanding  Media Extensions of Man said it perfectly “The medium is the  message ”1 Although theres no rule book on this you should consider  a few things to get the most out of your interactions  Lets start with who youre trying to communicate with  If its your  supervisor try deferring to their preferred method  This will likely  result in a shorter response time and a higher level of engagement  than if you use a method theyre not as intune with  Start by asking  “How do you like to be communicated with” or “What is the best way  to get in touch with you” This gives them the authority to choose and  it gives you the inside track on their preference  Dont assume everybody prefers the same method  Its best to be  direct and ask letting the individual in authority know youre  considering the most effective communication so you can get the job  done efficiently  But what if youre trying to communicate with  someone at the same level as you or the person of authority does not  give you a specific answer  Here are some guidelines to help you navigate that decision  And  just so were on the same page you dont have to hit on all of these  points every single time you send an email  But depending on the  scenario these are some things to consider before you hit send  Email  Here are times when email is likely the way to go  Straightforward information  Youre sending out something that  requires no conversation or questions and is limited to upfront content  invitation calendar of upcoming events etc  Different time zones  Were often working with people all over the  globe and it can be hard to sync up times for a call or video chat  Email can work well if youre trying to relay information to someone  outside your time zone  If the information falls into a “more complex”  bucket use email to schedule a conversation to ensure youre both  available at the same time  Off hours  If youre working late and need to get information out  email is much better than a phone call that interrupts family dinner  Consider the emotions of who you are reaching out to outside of work  hours  Most people want a break from their jobs and email is the least  invasive of the communication means  Remember that most things you  need to discuss are not emergencies and sending a latenight email  ensures the information is in their inbox first thing in the morning  When the recipient can be chatty  If there is someone who tends to  hold you up when youre just relaying information email can be a nice  way to keep things on task  They still get the information they need  and you dont have to be on the phone with them for an hour about  unrelated topics  CYA nicer way of saying “covering your ass”  There are times  when you just need information in writing  You can always have a  facetoface conversation and then summarize it and send it via email  But if youre looking for documentation email is the way to go  Try  being more specific by mentioning documented approvals recorded  history of longerrunning conversations and other details that will be  good to have on record  Follow up  If you have a terrible memory or you have a history of  taking bad notes email can be a way to recap a conversation to make  sure youre on the same page  USES FOR EMAIL  •  Providing straightforward information  •  Distributing content during off hours and with colleagues in  different time zones  •  Documenting and following up with information  Phone Video Chat or InPerson  For anything deeper than what works in email having an in  person conversation is usually the best way to communicate  This  gives us the chance to see body language and hear the other persons  tone  But in todays working environment thats not always possible  With the constant improvement in audio and video technology video  or phone conversations can have a similar impact to inperson  conversations at least until my dream of teleportation is available  Consider the following scenarios for times when a more audiovisual  experience would result in more effective communication  High emotions  Whenever there is the potential for something to be  emotional you want to talk to the other party in person  Messages can  easily get confused through email and when youre having a  conversation either face to face or over the phone the tone is much  easier to navigate  We tend to overreact when we dont understand the  full context  Whether its apologizing for a mistake clarifying a  miscommunication or explaining some tough feelings about a project  gone awry—a facetoface or voicetovoice conversation is needed  HUMAN CONNECTION  Too often we allow our own feelings of inadequacy to decode the  messages we receive from others  When we cannot read their body  language are they smiling relaxed angry crying etc  or hear the  tone in their voice upbeat depressed loud etc  we fill in what we  are feeling at the time  Bold text italics fonts punctuation—all alter  our meanings  We need to take the time to understand what is being  said compare it with the person we know and reach out when they  dont match  LORI ROSENTHAL Strategic Human Resources Partner  Urgent issues  If you need information immediately from someone  and their office is two doors down get up and go talk with them  If  theyre not in your physical location but its during office hours give  them a call or start a video chat  When you send an email youre not  guaranteed to get an immediate response to an urgent issue even after  adding one of those red flags  By flagging them down a bit more  literally youre more likely to start moving toward a solution  Feedback  Providing feedback should always be done verbally  especially when youre providing constructive feedback  This allows  the other person the opportunity to ask questions gain insight and  ask for support right away without anything getting lost in email  translation  This does not apply to official reviews that need to be  documented and always paired with conversations but are written  out for logistics and support  The endless email circle  We all get involved in emails that start  innocently but drag on leave questions unanswered or even start a  whole new thread of topics  The email chain that never ends is  frustrating  It can be much more efficient to have a fluid conversation  with someone then it is to sift through days of emails to search for info  and answers  If you know the conversation is going to require a lot of  questions youll save time energy and headaches by stopping in  someones office or picking up the phone  Always consider if others  need to be included in this conversation as well to make sure they can  join in the fun  USES FOR PHONE VIDEO CHAT OR INPERSON  CONVERSATION  •  Supporting dialogue with high emotional impact  •  Discussing urgent issues  •  Providing feedback  •  Ending the endless email circle  Text and Instant Messaging  Although email face to face and phone calls may be some of the  more common ways to communicate in the workplace the use of  texting and messaging platforms is on the rise especially for  Millennials and Gen Z  However these instamethods can tricky  More  so than other mediums they are dependent on company culture  individual preference and the relationships between recipients  If your organization doesnt provide a company phone texting  someones personal number might be off limits and doing so might be  a seen as inappropriate regardless of intent  Even if you do have a  manager or coworkers number its important to ask for permission  before you text something work related so you do not cross any lines  Texting isnt the best form of communication in which to do business  and it should be reserved for personal conversations  Some organizations have an instant messaging IM system  however this isnt intended for lengthy backandforth exchanges in  which people feel chained to their desk waiting for your next message  or response  You also want to keep an eye out for availability settings  so you do not disturb someone while they are in a meeting or working  on a timesensitive project  Before using either of these mediums  consider the following scenarios  Casual content  If youre leaving for lunch left brownies in the  kitchen or need access to a shared document an instant message is  perfect  Once youve asked your question or shared your brief  information its time to move on and get down to business  Dont take  this interaction for a fullon conversation  Conversation primer  Instead of heading straight for someones  office use instant messaging to both save you extra steps and gauge if  someone is available for a quick chat  “Are you free Can I pop in your  office and ask you a question” “Can I give you a call in five minutes  to review the Anderson case”  Quick answer  Most questions are quick in delivery but the  answers can be lengthy  When choosing either of these mediums first  decide whether the answer is straightforward  If so a simple message  or text can be the way to go  When youre sending longwinded tasks  through IM however most likely youre leaving the person on the  other end frantically copying and pasting instructions into a document  before they accidentally close the messaging window and the  instructions all go away  An IM also suggests a sense of urgency for  that person to stop what theyre doing and complete your request  If  its complex or a fullon project leave the IM out of it  If your  exchange goes back and forth three times with no resolution its time  to hop on a call or have a facetoface conversation  USES FOR TEXT AND INSTANT MESSAGING  •  Sharing casual information  •  Priming an inperson virtual or phone conversation  •  Disseminating information with straightforward and quick answers  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Whether emailing texting calling or popping in to a colleagues  office stay in tune with how the recipient is receiving your  communication and if it is working for them  Not good at picking up  on these clues Ask them directly about their preferences  The goal is  to have communication that leads to answers solutions and  productive outcomes  And this means adapting to what works best in  each scenario and each relationship  CHAPTER 9  Mixing Up Meetings and the Power  of New Spaces  THE WAY WE WORK is constantly evolving and a onesizefitsall  physical space doesnt provide us with what we need for the different  elements of our roles  Think of a “typical” office with four walls a  stationary desk a few drawers two chairs a computer some office  supplies and a shared printer that only seems to work from 130 p m  until 137 p m  How can this space inspire creativity while allowing  you to have oneonone conversations conduct larger meetings and  visualize the flow of the next big project or idea It cant We all need  different spaces to get the creativity juices flowing and to interact with  our colleagues supervisors and outside constituents  Many companies and organizations are changing their structural  design to provide these spaces in which their employees engage in  conversations host and hold meetings more effectively and enhance  collaboration and innovation  These tweaks have helped build  relationships and communication and enhance productivity  All organizations have some form of a hierarchy  But we dont  have to make them so visually obvious  There are plenty of  opportunities to shake things up and give power to people who  sometimes feel like theyre at the bottom of the food chain  These  changes dont have to be earth shattering  They can be simple and  they can happen without big spending by the company  For example plenty of times I have been sitting directly across  from my boss in their “power chair” trying to engage and I just  havent felt like I had the power to do so  And it wasnt because they  werent giving me the floor to ask and answer questions or to provide  additional feedback but because there was this wall the desk in front  of us  The large executive desk felt like a force field that I couldnt  cross over  They could lean back in their comfy leather chair or spin  around in circles if they wanted whereas I was on the other side in a  semiuncomfortable nonmoving chair which made it feel like I was  about a mile away  This is a classic workspace problem that doesnt  need to be fixed with a fullblown renovation  Although tearing down walls and making big changes may be in  the cards for some organizations others may not have such deep  pockets  So in this chapter were going to review both big and small  adjustments we can make to our existing spaces as well as  conversations we can have if were in the market to shake things up  entirely  Even minor adjustments to our working spaces give us all the  power to drive changes in communication  Before taking a deep dive into a major reconstruction project lets  start with the basics  These basic changes can come from any member  of your organization and dont require a lot of money if any  These  are adjustments that you can implement immediately and they will  have an instant positive impact on the conversations you have with  others in your company  Stand Up  Sitting through an hourlong meeting can be torturous  Similarly  having to wait days for a weekly meeting when something needs to be  addressed immediately can be the worst  One of my supervisors  handled both of these problems by instituting 15minute standing  meetings during a busy season  We would all gather in his office at the  start of the day and chat quickly about what was on the docket the  issues we were facing and what support we needed  In these meetings  we were open to helping one another and making fast decisions and  we werent stuck waiting a week to resolve timely issues  Keep in mind  that standing meetings shouldnt be more than 15 minutes no one  wants to stand for much longer should be informal in nature and can  be daily weekly or whatever time period is warranted  Switch Seats  Who said that a meeting with the boss has to mean meeting in the  bosss office If youre a supervisor suggest meeting in your  employees office  If youre an employee scheduling a meeting put the  location in your office  Theres something about sitting in the  figurative drivers seat once in a while that helps break down some  barriers  This idea of course assumes you have an office with a door  and arent in an open floor plan where meeting will bother the people  around you  If youre working on spicing up a group meeting try changing up  the location and seats  In one of my previous roles we had twohour  meetings every week in the same room  Although the chairs were  comfy and the white boards were handy the room felt like it was  caving in after a while  Managers dont always have to sit at the head  of table  They are not your grandparent and this is not Thanksgiving  A change of venue distributes the power  In the end it can cultivate  some awesome ideas in a new freeing space  Move Your Chair  If your desk is sandwiched between your chair and your visitors  consider moving your chair to the side of your desk so youre almost  sitting next to the person youre having a conversation with  When  youre speaking with someone in your office this simple shift of your  chair makes the conversation more intimate and starts to break down  that perceived force field that you can feel from having the desk in  between you and them  Take Turns Leading  Although this isnt a structural or physical change giving someone  else the opportunity to lead in a meeting can change the dynamics and  enhance feedback and discussion  Are there parts of the agenda  another employee could lead Can teams alternate in leading each  week Give people the chance and show that you trust them to take  ownership of discussions  This will give other employees confidence in  presenting while giving managers the ability to gauge an employees  leadership development  If you do try this strategy make sure not to  spring it on them at the last minute  Give them notice so theyll have  time to prepare  Now lets move on to some areas that I would consider middle  ground  Were still not knocking down walls but we are making  changes to the way we work that might take a little more time to get  used to  Reshape Your Tables  When we think about people gathering for a meeting and sitting  at one large table its pretty typically a rectangle or oblong shape  This  boardroomstyle table provides a head for someone to lead the  meeting from and it can be the most space efficient  Although this  style is useful on some occasions for the daytoday functions and  more casual team meetings it perpetuates a hierarchical experience  The head of the table tends to be the person leading while everyone  else sits around it  To even the playing field its best to find configurations that dont  focus on one or a few people  Shapes that are more conducive to  creating spaces for more open communication are  Circular  Round tables work well to create a collaborative work  environment for a small group of people  Even if its just two  employees theres no clear divide or emphasis on one person over the  other and no matter where you sit youre not choosing sides  Square  Square tables provide four even sides and depending on  the size you can fit several in one room  If at times you need a more  traditional board room for certain events this style can easily be  expanded to a rectangle by adding another table  “U” or “C ” These configurations work well for presentations  video conferences small meetings and workshops  These work best  when youre looking to combine presentations and group interactions  with discussions so everyone can physically see others in the room  This isnt to say you need to throw all of your rectangular tables  to the curb  But if youre looking to update furniture or add some new  pieces the shapes just listed are worth considering instead of always  going the regular rectangular route  Other styles to consider for trainings or companywide meetings  are  School  Smaller rectangle tables with a few seats at each table  facing forward  The table allows for participants to take notes use  their devices and eat while listening to a speaker  This works best for  trainings or seminars  Vshaped  This style is very similar to the school setup but instead  of the tables facing forward they are angled to the center with an aisle  in the middle—making a V shape  This small change in angle allows  the person on the farthest end of each row to get a better view of the  speaker  Theatre  This is a row of chairs facing forward with an aisle in the  center and space on the sides for people to walk up and down  This  setup works for companywide meetings or larger conferences  But if  youre looking for interaction between the attendees or for them to  take notes this isnt the best fit  Encourage Shared Spaces  Its so easy for us to stay in one space if we dont have meetings  and are buckling down to work through projects  But if everyone has  their face down and is on the computer all day every day were in  trouble  You can make minor changes that provide employees with  opportunities to get out of their workspaces and interact with others  while still enhancing productivity  These adjustments dont cost a lot  and can even wind up saving money  • Create a centralized location for printing and limit machines in  individual spaces  • Add communal trash and recycling bins to various locations across the  office and remove cans from individual spaces so employees need to  get up to throw something away  • Provide coat racks or closets in communal spaces and encourage  hanging outerwear in those locations  • Encourage people to use centralized locations to enjoy their meal by  offering tables chairs and booths at which people can gather  • Add inexpensive furniture like ottomans and hightop tables in  communal spaces and encourage employees to use them for small  group conversations  As with any type of change it takes time to implement these  things into company culture  Throwing a few bean bags in the center  of the office wont necessarily bring people to these areas but if  leadership is promoting and using this space more other employees  are likely to follow  Communicate the impending changes by  providing the necessary information and offer a forum in which  people can ask questions  This way everyone is well aware of where  their trashcans went  HUMAN CONNECTION  One of the biggest barriers to an open floor model is acoustical  interruption  Its important to set precedents and protocols of how you  collaborate in a space without interrupting someone elses ability to  concentrate  Our company has made an active effort to establish these  protocols  If your phone call or conversation is more than two minutes  in an open area we move it to a huddle room or another enclosed  location to be less disruptive  If were presenting during a conference  call or webinar we use a meeting room  And if were on a conference  call where we wont be talking all that much we stay in our  workplace  Were also trying to promote the use of our work café by hosting  continuing education courses every Tuesday and Thursday in that  location  It has sound masking white noise a pantry set up with  snacks and coffee cateringsized refrigerators a mug washer  upholstered steps to sit on different sizes of tables and lounge seating  and loungers with articulated keyboard trays  We also have clickshare  to easily share what were working on with our group  These varied  spaces provide options for individuals and large and small teams to  collaborate  AMY GALLAGHER Senior Interior Designer at Nelson  Add Some Color  The colors of our spaces have an impact on our moods emotions  productivity and interactions with others  According to a study from  the University of Texas at Austin employees who work in bluegreen  blue or subtle white spaces experience a higher level of satisfaction in  their jobs and have increased performance 1 Knowing what mood and  emotion a color brings is important when youre trying to create an  inclusive and productive environment  Below are some other colors to  consider when updating spaces  Red  Soft shades can create a cozy environment  Orange Earthy shades can bring feelings of relaxation  Purple Muted tones can create an airy atmosphere and richer tones bring  thoughts of importance  White  Tinted and softer shades create a more open and welcoming space  Yellow Softer tones can show hospitality and energy  Knock Down Walls  Knocking down walls rearranging workspaces and investing in  alternative furniture is no small task or expense  Its not something to  be taken lightly and should be carefully considered researched and  approved  Organizations that value a culture of openness and  transparency dont always translate this into their structural spaces  And being able to identify what changes can be made within your  organization before making huge adjustments is vital  Many companies including Apple and Amazon are spending the  time and money to ensure that their spaces encourage conversations  and collaboration  But each situation is different and how you define  and experience collaboration and innovation will dictate the direction  you take  Taking the time to gain a deeper insight into the structural  needs of your employees will be well worth the effort  HUMAN CONNECTION  At my last job the entire organization moved from an oldschool  brick office building into a brand new modern highrise  After decades  of working in traditional drywalled offices all of the departments  were to be moved to an open concept allglass environment  It was a  big change  Senior leadership knew there would be resistance and made a lot  of effort to ease the transition  They sent out frequent messaging with  updates had open forums for asking questions and even led hardhat  tours of the new space as it was it being built  They formed different  committees open to everyone who wanted to be involved in the  process a community and culture committee for initiatives around  creating a positive office culture an art committee for selecting the art  that would be displayed on the walls  And they actively and  thoughtfully addressed employees needs for new tools in order to  adjust to the new space—noise canceling headphones for those who  needed quiet to concentrate computer monitor shades for those now  in brighter windowside workspaces  Of course there were always going to be employees who were  negative—the ones who would complain no matter what  But there  was also plenty of positivity and excitement  Yes most employees  were losing their private office spaces and the ability to close a door  during a phone call  It was a drastic change in work space  But instead  of an outright revolt from the staff the good attitudes helped drown  out the griping ones  Leadership empowered their employees to  contribute to their new space and it really made a difference in the  transition  COLLEEN Marketing and Communications Professional  Through my conversations with managers and employees I found  a common issue—they lack easy access to spaces for impromptu  meetings  Whether they work in a building with private offices open  floor plans or a combination of both they do not have many spaces  for a few people to gather to have a spurofthemoment conversation  Some of the specialty spaces being designed to help organizations with  these issues are  Work cafés  These spaces promote social connection in an informal  setting  They typically have booths rectangular tables and hightop  tables where employees can grab lunch and a latte and have a  conversation  You can host spontaneous or planned meetings in these  more open locations  Huddle rooms  This is a smaller space for two to five people to  gather for a quick impromptu and informal conversation  These are  not meant for allday meetings and should have an easy technology  hook up with visible instructions for all users popping in and out of  the room  Videoconference space  These larger rooms provide a space for an  inperson team to gather and have a virtual conversation with others  A larger screen is placed where everyone in the room can be seen and  heard by the virtual participants  Brainstorm room  Although you can use a huddle room or other  location for a quick idea session with a small team brainstorm rooms  can be used for extended periods for larger groups  Participants should  be able to write on walls large note pads or whiteboards  Additionally seating should be comfortable and tech should be  available and easy to use  Work podQuiet pod  These individual spaces can be the size of a  phone booth  Providing these private options is important when you  transition employees to an open office environment  When you ask  employees to shift from a private office where they can shut the door  to make a call to an open plan these spaces give them an opportunity  to still have some privacy  They provide a private environment in  which an employee can take a client or personal call or a visiting  remote worker can work for the day  They are not meant as a long  term solution to a private office  HUMAN CONNECTION  Im always very leery of architecture determinism the belief that if  we change the space the space will actually change the behavior  Its a  yin and yang relationship that requires proactive conversations  What  we see over and over again—because people dont have the type of  support they need for these physical change conversations—is poor  etiquette causing bad behavior  And then those behaviors cause  interruptions and distractions and generate noise  The behavior from a  cubicle environment is being carried over to open floor models  This  change is much more than taking down panels and having people  more exposed  Its important to rethink what activities go on and what  kind of support those activities require and then give people more  range to roam to different places during the day as opposed to sitting  in one place  People are looking for a greater variety of spaces and  that requires a change in the business model to reflect how people  think about space and space allocation  GARY MICIUNAS Workplace Strategist  Many companies allow employees to reserve some of these spaces  in advance while leaving others open and available for lastminute  conversations like huddle rooms and workquiet pods  By giving  employees a few options you provide them with opportunities for  both scheduled gatherings and impromptu calls or group discussions  Remember knocking down walls isnt always the answer but it  can be something to explore as you and your organization think about  where communication is now and where you want it to be  You can  start off by making small changes to your individual spaces like  coming out from behind that desk Experiment and see how to change  up your interactions especially if you dont have the power to call for  construction  If youre committed and in a position to make some  larger moves try bringing in an expert to ensure youre covering your  bases  You dont want your employees thinking “Did they even put  any thought into this before making these changes”  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Finding the balance between “we” and “me” is crucial when  creating and bringing to life your workspace  Although its important  to have the space to think and work independently we need to make  an active effort to include people and not draw more attention to the  hierarchy that exists  Simply moving your chair changing up the  location of your next meeting or going all out and creating an entirely  new space can be effective  But one things for sure   if we dont do  anything nothing will change  If you really want to get the  conversation going get rid of the chair get rid of the table and get  outside of your roles  PART IV  Be Comfortable with the  Uncomfortable  CHAPTER 10  Working with Toxic People  EVERY WORK ENVIRONMENT is not a perfect match of  personalities  Weve all had that difficult coworker or boss or  potentially have acted like one and they can make our lives  miserable These are the people who seem to go out of their way to  disagree with our opinions and always stir up drama  Although I  would love to spend pages ranting about this population I think its  more important to know who they are and what we can do to make  our interactions more productive  When starting one of my previous positions I was eager to learn  the ropes navigate the material and be of help to anyone who asked  But most of the content we needed to know to perform our jobs was  not online in a manual or documented in any sort of way  The  unwritten department policy was that if you wanted to learn you  needed to observe and ask questions of people with institutional  knowledge and then it was sink or swim  Being the eager person that I am I asked a coworker a clients  question I was struggling to answer on my own  They seemed happy to  help and walked me through the response for which I thanked them  and then I took the information back to my client  Well it turns out  that the information they gave me was completely wrong  The client  reached out a few days later confused by my answer and after  additional research and a conversation with my supervisor we were  able to resolve the issue  Although my client was understanding this  incident put not only my reputation on the line but also my clients  trust in our organization  They could have easily walked away and  chosen to work with someone else  Later I overheard that same coworker talking with someone else  about how they gave me the wrong information on purpose to see  what I would do  Ever the optimist I gave them the benefit of the  doubt and asked another question later that week only to find out that  they had again given me incorrect information this time I did  additional research before I talked to the client  Sucky right It felt  horrible to know that someone was outright sabotaging me from the  getgo but I wasnt going to let that get in my way of trying to build a  working relationship with them  After this second time I invited them  to lunch to give us an opportunity to start to clear the air  Although  they never admitted to giving me the wrong information we were  able to have a civil discussion about the incident  We never became  friends or lunch buddies but we remained professional and generally  stayed out of each others way  I knew that because my coworker had been there for a long time  they would not be let go or even disciplined  So I needed to find a  way to work around the situation  And I certainly wasnt going to let it  get in the way of my success within the organization  I turned to  others as resources and created a manual for new employees to be able  to reference  I didnt want anyone to feel stuck without someone or  something to turn to if they had questions  Unfortunately my story is not unique  Many people have faced  situations in which their coworkers put them down or set them up for  failure for their own personal gain  Its hard to get past conversations  and situations that make you feel undermined or to shake off someone  who seems to always argue just for the sake of arguing  But ultimately  its important to build a working relationship with these people if for  no other reason than to get your job done without pulling your hair  out  Maybe Its Me  Before we dive into the types of toxic colleagues and how to  engage with them Im going to call out the elephant in the room  Weve all probably demonstrated a few of these behaviors at some  point in time but dont always fess up to it  Its a lot easier to blame  other people or assume theyre being unreasonable than it is to reflect  on our own behaviors  Take some time to do some selfreflection  before jumping into conversations with others  You may want to  consider  Conducting a 360 review  These reviews give others the  opportunity to anonymously provide insights on your interpersonal  skills  They usually include feedback from your manager and peers in  a structured online format giving you a better idea of how others view  you professionally  Asking for feedback  Open yourself up for feedback during oneon  one meetings formal reviews or with friends family and mentors  Ask what you can do differently to enhance your communication skills  and what theyve noticed about your communication style  Be open to  hearing some things you might not want to hear And dont get  annoyed at someone for sharing their honest opinion  Whether its  going in your ears or not its a perception that exists so try to process  what it means and how you might address it  Selfdiscovery  Have you found yourself playing the blame game a  lot On more than a few people and perhaps around the same topic or  concern Have you ever thought that people were just out to get you  For example do you think that no one can do their job as well as you  do yours regardless of what department theyre in Although such  thoughts might not be clear indicators that youre demonstrating toxic  behavior its something to note if it becomes a pattern  If you realize youre showing some toxic tendencies make an  active effort to do something about it  As a manager have oneonone  conversations with your team on how you can best support them  individually  Seek out leadership and communication training both  inside and outside your organization and apologize to those who have  been affected by your behavior refer to chapter 15 for some effective  tools  Seek out support from a coach or mentor to help you work  through personalized strategies to move past this behavior  WAYS TO IDENTIFY IF YOURE THE TOXIC  COLLEAGUE  •  Conduct a 360 review  •  Ask others for feedback  •  Spend some time in reflection and selfdiscovery  HUMAN CONNECTION  If you find that people always agree with you in meetings they  may be afraid to challenge your position  If your coworkers stop  talking when you come near them they may be uncomfortable around  you and may not consider you a part of their inner circle  If you sense  any of these warning signs strive to listen more  Take note of your  body language especially when someone else has something to share  with the group  If a coworker approaches you about being difficult  think before you speak  Pause and thank the coworker for sharing her  concern  Then talk about what steps you might take to make things  more comfortable  When we take ownership for our role in a  relationship we help open the lines of communication  Try something  like “Thanks for sharing this with me Suzy  Im so sorry that you feel  that way as that is not my intent  What could I do differently to make  our work relationship smoother” Then follow up in a week or so to  see if your coworker is feeling more comfortable  AMY COOPER HAKIM PhD Author of Working with Difficult People  and Founder of The Cooper Strategic Group  The Types of Toxic  Although it can be easy to identify obvious toxic behaviors like  screaming slamming doors or even purposely giving out the wrong  information—you might be faced with some more subtle ones  Labelling or generalizing employees  “Of course the Millennials want  a new coffee maker  What unnecessary thing are they going to ask for  next”  Ignoring your ideas  “So anyway were going to move forward with  my plan since everyone seems to be on board ”  Interrupting and never giving others the chance to speak “Let me  jump in Ive had the same experience and think we need to make  some changes ” Or not giving the headsup that they have something  to say and either talking right over people or talking nonstop  Patronizing those they feel are less experienced  “For the last 20 years  weve been doing it that way and its worked fine  Take it from  someone with experience theres no reason to change our protocols ”  These behaviors not only destroy relationships but also make it  difficult—if not impossible—to get your work done  Lets look at some  types of toxic coworkers and how they may demonstrate these  behaviors  TYPES  OF  TOXIC  EMPLOYEES  DESCRIPTION  The  Self  Absorbed  These are the people who always seem to shift the  conversations to be about them and cant be bothered with  what you have to say  You could be pouring your heart out  while they inevitably shift the spotlight back on  themselves making a story or situation about them  They  never seem to be attentive to your needs  “It sounds like  youre having a rough day but mine has been crazy too I  just got slammed with two new projects and have no idea  how I am going to do everything ”  The Blamer  They dont take responsibility for their actions and tend to  blame others for things not going as planned  Whether it is  missing project deadlines or not meeting their goals its  always someone elses fault they didnt meet expectations  They dont have any plans to change their ways because  its not their fault  “I havent had the chance to call the  client back because I was pulled into four meetings today  and my phone has been ringing off the hook  If I had extra  hands around here this wouldnt be an issue ”  The Controller These are the people that want to control any and all  decisions  They will stop at nothing to make sure you agree  with their point of view or complete the project in the way  they think is best  Your opinion doesnt matter and it  always goes in one ear and out the other  They want to  make sure they get the credit for the success  “Thats great  that you feel that way but were going with my plan ”  The  Dramatizer  Everything is a crisis and they cant seem to get over the  little things  They tend to rant on about something that  bothers them and try to bring people into their drama by  suggesting they should feel the same way  They can also be  the office gossip who walks around recruiting people to be  on their side about an issue  “Can you believe that Alexis is  making Joe answer the phones during lunch today Thats  so ridiculous doesnt she know how busy he is right now”  The  Complainer  Every job has someone who does nothing but complain  Theyre exhausting to be around and have no interest in  making things better or enacting changes  They just seem  to take joy in the griping They are not out to just get you  they seem to make it a point to criticize everyones  opinions and suggestions and rarely have anything  productive to say  This can be through oneonone  conversations or complaint sessions  Or they can be  someone who tends to yell publicly in the office  “Weve  tried that before and its not going to work ”  The Saboteur  A person who sabotages coworkers or takes all the credit  for their own professional benefit not working for the  benefit of others but to improve their standing in the eyes  of supervisors  They want all eyes on them and will make  an active effort to make that happen  My story at the  beginning of this chapter gives an example of providing  the wrong information for personal gain  The Critic  Someone who is always critiquing you  Whether it is how  you work or who you have lunch with they always seem  to have a suggestion on what you should be doing and it  most likely doesnt affect them in any way  They just want  you to know they have a better opinion or way of doing  something  “Grant you know if you just worked with Paul  like I suggested you would have finished this project an  hour ago ”  Communicating with Toxic Coworkers  Even though each of these categories of toxic colleagues are a  little different you can implement a few strategies in your daily  communication to make your interactions more bearable  As much as I  would love to wave a magic wand to rid the world of this type of  behavior the only behavior we can control and adjust is our own  Remember these are people you have to be around and work with  every day  They may be very important to how the company  functions so your own success depends on your ability to work with  them  Bring Up Bad Behavior  For the most part toxic people are not aware that their actions  are in fact toxic  Their personalities may be based in how they have  professionally succeeded to this point in their career  They continue  their ways and sometimes wonder why things dont work out while  being completely oblivious to the rolling eyes around the room  If this behavior impacts your ability to complete your work and  you are looking to change the behavior as opposed to work around it  you can make the other person aware of their behavior  Were not  talking about a verbal or physical confrontation—youll need to find  another way to address these coworkers that stifle creativity dont  listen or arent open to your ideas and suggestions  Looking to change someones behavior is not easy or sometimes  even possible  But if you want to bring up this behavior with a  colleague try all of the following steps  Use facts and be specific  Verbatim or as close to word for word as  possible recite what the other person said  Avoid accusatory language  that points the finger  Terms like always and never can make a person  feel attacked  Instead be specific about the time of the incident that  youre addressing like “this morning” or “during the meeting ” “During  our morning meeting when I was providing a suggestion for our new  app you mentioned that weve tried that before and it didnt work ”  Expressing your feelings  Share how this persons behavior made  you feel  “I didnt feel that I was given the chance to share my idea  fully with the team before you made your comment that ended the  conversation ”  Providing alternatives  Let them know how you would prefer to  work together and ask for their support or alternative suggestions  Try  having these conversations in a comfortable nonstressful environment  Maybe take it outside of the everyday workplace so that you can both  focus on the conversation and not on the tension left in the meeting  room  “In the future I would greatly appreciate you giving me the  chance to fully share my ideas to our group before saying whether or  not you believe it is a good idea  Is this something you would be able  to do”  HUMAN CONNECTION  Whether we admit it or not most adults ascribe to a “Whats in it  for me” philosophy  So a difficult coworker is more likely to listen to  your ideas if they understand how it will benefit them to do so  Try  saying this before offering a suggestion “I have an idea that I know  the boss will really like ” Or “This worked for me when I was at my  previous company so it is definitely worth considering ”  If your coworker refuses to let you speak without constant  interruption consider writing down ideas before your meeting and  encourage them to do the same  Then take turns sharing your ideas as  you discuss each one  Dont forget to speak up when there is a break in  dialogue  “Good idea Jim  Heres another angle that I thought of  ”  Sometimes a supervisor might appear to know all of the answers  Even if they think that they are always right however they will still  want to hear something that will make them look good to their  supervisor  Try saying this before offering a suggestion “I know that  this works well for our competition so I think we should see if it could  work for us too ” Or “Mary found great success using this approach ”  AMY COOPER HAKIM PhD Author of Working with Difficult People  and Founder of The Cooper Strategic Group  Although it would be nice to be able to have this conversation  once and have everything be resolved it most likely wont be the only  time  If youre committed to adjusting this persons behavior to work  together better expect to have a conversation after each instance of  this behavior  For example if at the next meeting you try to bring up  another idea and they cut you off have a similar conversation with  this person afterward  It takes conscious effort time and persistence  to move the needle forward on someones behavior that theyve likely  spent years exhibiting  Remember that these behaviors and  personalities may be engrained in a coworkers work personality so  they are not going to magically change  And if youre not their  supervisor they may be resistant to change for someone they dont  report to—making it even more difficult for it to stick  But without  putting in this effort youll feel even more stuck in the mud and  powerless  Do your part in trying to make things better  HUMAN CONNECTION  I ran into a situation in which I was working with an abrasive  colleague  Our natural inclination is to avoid these individuals but I  realized that they had the potential to add a lot of value and took a  proactive approach to building the relationship  Our companys culture and core values center around valuing  others  So I forced myself to dig deeper and “peel the onion” as my  high school theatre teacher used to say  What were my perceptions of  my colleague and what might be driving those perceptions Was it  cultural bias Differences in communication styles It is difficult to  address interpersonal issues in a meaningful way if were not willing to  do any introspection on our own  Lets face it sometimes we are the  problem not them  Anyway after I did this I realized that I did not  know this person well enough to make any kind of determination  about them and the way forward  I scheduled a checkin to get to know them  Rather than delving  into any issues immediately which might have put them on the  defense we chatted about their professional background their work  what they like about it and what challengespain points they have  I  then pushed a little further into the intersection of how my work and  my teams work had an impact on theirs to get a sense of what was  going well and to find opportunities for improvement  I learned a lot in that hourlong conversation  We had two very  different styles of communication  Im a bit more diplomatic and they  were very direct which came from a strict upbringing  I also learned  more about their personal core values and at the heart of them are  accountability and doing the work correctly which strongly drives the  way they work with others  This really informed the way I now work  with them because I realized that there are certain nonnegotiables if  we are going to effectively work together  CHRISTINA MERRIWEATHER Enrollment Manager  TIPS FOR DISCUSSING TOXIC BEHAVIOR  •  Share the facts and be specific  •  Express your feelings  •  Provide alternatives  So youve put in the effort and its not going anywhere  If  youre not making progress with your conversations or are looking to  move past or around this behavior its time to take a different  approach  These following suggestions will give you a tool kit for  lessening the blow of a toxic coworker  Dont Take the Bait  I get it its hard to give respect when you feel like youre not  getting it  But being rude back isnt going to get you heading anywhere  in a positive direction  When you take the bait youre giving them  exactly what theyre looking for especially with a toxic person  One of the most interesting stories Ive heard from an HR manager  is their experience working with two employees who got into a  physical confrontation after many previous arguments  One  employee had just had enough from his controlling peer who would  not listen or take his ideas seriously  He was tired of being pushed  around and proceeded to grab his coworkers privates to “show him  who was boss” in the middle of the factory assembly floor  Needless to  say he did not handle this situation properly and as a result no  longer works for the company  Whether what he was arguing for was right or wrong certainly  doesnt matter anymore  You dont have to agree with people but you  should always be respectful  If you have a tendency to flare up and  say or do things you regret keep a strategy at the ready  Take a breath maybe several  Dont jump right in  Take a moment  to collect your thoughts  If you need to excuse yourself to get some  water or use the restroom before moving forward with the  conversation  Create boilerplate responses  These phrases might sound forced but  thats OK Its way better than stooping to their level  Be aware of your  tone and dont be condescending demeaning or sarcastic when  responding  Try these phrases on for size “Ill look into that ” “Thank  you for your feedback ” “I appreciate your feedback ”  Shift the dialogue  Make an effort to change the direction of the  conversation  If someone stole your idea and is trying to play it off as  their own try restating your idea and adding “Heres what Im  thinking  ” Then add your strategy and tactics so everyone knows  that you have spent time thinking about this  If someone has cut you  off say “Let me finish my point” or “I would like to say something ”  To shift the dialogue its important to be mindful of your tone and  share your knowledge without putting the other person down  Find a Mediator  Sometimes relationships are so damaged that theyre seriously  getting in the way of work  In this case reach out to your supervisor  andor human resources to schedule a meeting with a nonbiased  thirdparty present to help you clear the air  This helps get both of  your voices heard so you can start to get on the same page  This route  may also be appropriate if you are not getting a response or if the  same thing keeps happening when youre trying to handle it by  yourself  Ignore Them  This can be tricky if you need to consistently work with this  person  If your daily tasks and projects dont typically align with this  persons work try to ignore them  Dont step in the line of fire if you  dont have to  When something comes up and you need to work with  them ask for support from your supervisor who should already be  aware of the situation  If they arent now is the time to fill them in  Detach Yourself  All strategies aside some people just suck Ive heard countless  stories about employees and bosses who scream when they want  something done dont get their way or just feel like people arent  listening to what theyre saying—like a small child having a temper  tantrum  These people can be notoriously hard to work with and  honestly they will most likely never change this deeprooted behavior  The best thing to do in these situations is not engage stay calm and  not try to be the hero Hint Theyre not even listening  The process of  engaging is apt to just bring you down and make you feel defeated  Make a commitment to detach yourself from the behavior and  consciously decide that its their problem not yours  If it gets over the  top or you feel threatened contact the appropriate person—your  supervisor or someone in human resources  This is going to take some  serious selftalk to fully commit to but it is worth the effort  Its hard  to remove your feelings from someone elses behavior but if you know  that you deserve better it becomes a little easier  Practice saying to  yourself “I will no longer be made to feel devalued and  unappreciated  I am worthy of respect and appreciation ”  Dont Become the Toxic Employee  Dont drag someone else into the mess who shouldnt be involved  Just because you have an issue with a coworker doesnt mean you  should create a coup against them  Bringing other peers into it will not  help you in the long run  It can lead to more stress for the people you  bring in make them feel like they need to take sides or even add  more work to their plates in their efforts to help you avoid your peer  HUMAN CONNECTION  Human Resources wants to know about actions that can impact  the company  Many organizations have policies that require employees  to immediately report any harassment bullying or discrimination  These types of circumstances should not be handled on your own  For other issues you want to identify the severity of the situation  If your coworker is providing persistent and unreasonable criticism  insulting or treating you with disrespect spreading rumors not  following through on tasks or not listening to your ideas you can  start to address these issues on your own  The first step is to have a  conversation with the other person to give them a chance to  discontinue this type of behavior  If it continues and your  communication methods are not working bring it up to HR  Although  you dont want to be viewed as a tattletale or complainer when a  situation is serious and you are not making progress speaking to the  offender HR can be a valuable resource  ANONYMOUS Human Resource Professional  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Try to give people the benefit of the doubt even when its tough  Its important to create the space and opportunities for open  conversations especially with people we dont really want to talk to  We all have a story to tell experiences that shape us and personalities  that help us stand out  Remember to be kind and assume the best  intentions  Spend your energy on empathy and understanding—not  anger  Make an effort to address behaviors that are affecting your day  to day but know when there are some things you just cant change  Decide for yourself if you need to escalate an issue detach from it or  perhaps remove yourself completely from an environment or a person  CHAPTER 11  Turning Down Ideas Not People  NOT EVERYTHING WE SAY or do is going to be amazing  And  although my grandfather used to love to say “Im not always right but  Im never wrong” well he was—umm—wrong  You are going to be  wrong at some point and probably more than just once  However despite occasionally missing the mark with a game  changing idea few things are more distressing than someone putting  the kibosh on that idea preemptively—before we fully express it  shooting it down without a real explanation  And communicating that  an idea or plan is not going to work can be delicate  I get it we dont  want to waste our time tiptoeing around criticism for fear of hurting  someones feelings but we also want people to know that we heard  their idea listened and then made a thoughtful decision  It all comes  down to how we deliver that message  I will never forget how rude I was to one of my coworkers during  a particular situation at a previous job  Our department had been  broken up into smaller groups to complete parts of a larger project  During one followup meeting we came together and shared what we  worked on seeking feedback and buyin from the larger group  One of  my coworkers wanted to do a roleplay for an upcoming training and  had spent hours scripting exactly what each of the volunteers would  say  I sat there listened to his suggestion and said “I dont like that  Im not going to do it ” Yep I didnt think his idea would resonate with  the clients made a quick judgment and shut him down in the middle  of the meeting  I outright rejected his idea which in the end was the  right call but the way I went about it could have fractured both our  relationship and my coworkers confidence  We left the meeting and I could tell that he was upset  Not only  because I was being ridiculously rude but also because he had spent  so much time preparing and was invested in his work  I collected my  thoughts and quickly realized that the way I spoke was not only  insulting but that I had done it in front of our whole team  I hadnt let  him share why he thought a roleplay made sense in this scenario nor  did I offer alternative suggestions or an explanation of my reasoning  for disagreeing  I waited until the next morning to give him some space and to  allow myself to collect my thoughts before I approached the issue  As  soon as I stepped into the building the next day I went to his office  and asked if he had a few moments to discuss yesterdays meeting  He  kindly agreed and we went on a short walk together to talk it over  Leaving the office was important we were equal players in the  conversation and finding a neutral location made us both more  comfortable  Leaving the scene of the crime so to speak took some of  the tension out of the air  I apologized for my negative attitude and for saying no to his idea  before he had a chance to explain  I then gave my coworker the floor  to talk about his concerns and how my words made him feel  I went  on to make a personal promise that I wouldnt insult his or anyone  elses ideas in a public forum  And although I would still say no to  ideas in a meeting if I thought they might not work I would do so in  manner that did not put the person down—in other words I would  turn down the idea not the person  I would find a way to voice my  dissent in a more diplomatic way and then have a conversation with  the person presenting the idea one on one  This dialogue became a  game changer in our working relationship  But not being rude is just the start to diplomatically disagreeing  with an idea  Navigating this space and arming yourself with strategies  can help you not only avoid burning bridges but also enhance  relationships by sharing your thoughts in a tactful way  HUMAN CONNECTION  Judgments and harsh criticisms stifle the creative process  Its  important to find the positive elements in the original idea while  providing gentle constructive criticism and next steps  Ive learned that  providing specific things to think about and areas to develop can  improve the creative process if communicated caringly  I also have  asked for permission to provide these suggestions “Do you mind if I  tell you what is good about your idea and what can be improved  upon” “Do you want me to tell you why this might work and why it  might not work”  Its necessary to be trustworthy and respectful in this process as  these ideas are often someones dream  “I like what youve started  here and have you considered this   ” “I apologize in advance if  my feedback seems harsh or overly pointed  ” This tactful language  shows that you are interested in helping them finding alternatives to  work through their concepts  JOHN MCADAM Business Advisor and Author of The One Hour  Business Plan  All Complaints No Solutions  When we say no or complain about something not being effective  we better be prepared to come up with an alternative solution  In my  earlier example when I told my coworker that I wasnt going to  participate in his idea I didnt offer any viable alternative  I  complained because I didnt think it would be an effective way to  showcase our point and I didnt speak in a way that invited others to  provide other options  Instead I could have provided a constructive  challenge in which I built on what my coworker said and provided an  enhancement to their plan instead of changing the plan completely  “I  think I see where youre going with the roleplays and that youre  looking for the participants to act out a scenario to see how the  audience would react  Would you consider formulating a roleplay that  isnt scripted Perhaps we could provide them with a prompt or let  them choose a scenario that theyre currently facing This could help  them take it one step further ”  The tweaking of my phrasing would have allowed for a  conversation about why they chose to script the roleplays and  potentially move the needle toward doing something different  A flat  out “No Im not going to do that” or “Thats not going to work” will  not create a constructive conversation  If something isnt going to work  out or if you dont agree with a proposed idea provide an alternative  to the suggestion  Just saying you dont like something or that you  dont want to do it isnt an answer and ultimately if you handle  things this way you end up portraying yourself as someone who isnt  open to new ideas and different perspectives  HUMAN CONNECTION  When our office was bought by a younger doctor we went  through a lot of changes  One of them was upgrading the technology  so patients could schedule their own appointments online and shifting  from paper to electronic records  In an industry where a lot of offices  still use paper records and are only being reluctantly dragged kicking  and screaming into a digital world this move was unusual  The  doctor my new boss also falsely assumed that because he was  comfortable and proficient with technology our staff would be also  The technology platform was new to all of the front desk staff  including myself and we were just provided with the training material  with no formal review of how to use it  From the start I knew this was  going to be difficult as the system was unforgiving of simple errors and  very time consuming to use even for a simple task  It also did not  meet our needs and the doctors expectations were unrealistic  Unfortunately he chose the platform without asking the staff for input  and assessed it based on tasks he had never performed  After using it for a few months he realized that the platform he  chose was not meeting expectations  Instead of looking into alternative  options on his own he is now involving our staff in the process so he  can understand how we use it and ensure that it can meet his  expectations for transferring data  ANONYMOUS  Stop Using Terrible Phrases  Be honest Have you ever been the one to shoot an idea down in  front of others The one who made someone feel uncomfortable about  something they worked on Youre not alone But heres the deal  there are ways to say you dont like something without immediately  pushing people away and stifling their creativity  Take it from me and  learn from my mistakes  And remove these phrases from your  vocabulary  • “Thats the way its always been done ”  • “Thats just the way we do things ”  • “Thats the way it is ”  • “Dont fix something that isnt broken ”  • “Figure it out ”  • “No ” When said before really hearing someone out  You may have seen these in an email before or maybe youve  even had the pleasure of being shot down in person—and better yet in  a room full of your colleagues  Fun right But at the end of the day  these are just rude phrases for telling someone no  So lets break them  down a little bit to give you a better idea of why they suck and then  well talk through alternatives  “Thats the way its always been done ” “Weve always done it this  way ” “Thats the way it is ” “Thats just the way we do things ” These  similar phrases tell the person that youre not open to new ideas  Its a  copout answer with no explanation  And who is this “we” that were  talking about Is it you The organization Everyone This does not  explain why their idea isnt going to work and why youre not going  with it  Instead try providing the following information  What we do  Explain the process the role or the scenario in  detail  How we do it  Review how this actually gets done  Why we do it  Explain why you do it this specific way  Address  why  you  cant try this new  way  Explain what might be difficult with the newly  proposed way and what issues you see causing  roadblocks  “I appreciate your suggestion Todd  We have a tight deadline  with this project and several departments are involved  Weve  communicated our current plan to all parties and it assures that we  will be on schedule and within budget  Although we cant make a  change in plans for this project lets discuss your idea in full detail  later as we have several similar initiatives coming up  What does your  schedule look like next Friday at 100 p m ”  Make it clear that you appreciate creative thinking for new  solutions explain why their idea wont work in this instance and offer  a specific time to talk about how it could be developed elsewhere  “Dont fix something that isnt broken ” This phrase suggests that  everything is fine with a process and there is no need to ever evaluate  or create something more efficient or effective  It also shows we might  be too lazy to change things up and try something new  An employee  isnt coming to you because the current way of doing things is not  working but because they think it can be enhanced to better meet or  exceed the needs of others  Using a phrase like this is a turnoff  especially for Millennial and Gen Z employees who grew up learning  through technology  We can always do something to enhance a  process this just might not be the right time and place to make that  change  “Blair thank you for your suggestion for improving the  response rates for our client surveys  Although I agree that your  method is something to explore its not something we have the  resources to dedicate to at the moment  Lets get together offline after  the meeting to talk through alternative budget options timelines and  resource allocation ”  “Figure it out ” This reply often comes after someone asks for help  Although I am sometimes a fan of a sinkorswim approach having  people do certain things on their own without any guidance or  resources is usually not the best option  image Provide resources online manual video tutorials links  image If youre unsure of the answer suggest an alternative  person to whom they should direct the question  image Be supportive  “Darla I understand that you need help learning how to use our  phone system and with forwarding calls  I would suggest reaching out  to Brandon because he is a wiz with our phone system  We also have a  video library that will show you step by step how to use it I will  forward you the link ”  “No” When said before really hearing someone out  I am a believer  that “No ” is a complete sentence and an appropriate response for  certain situations like if your kid asks you if they can go to the 84th  kids birthday party of the summer—just say no and move on  But in  the workplace its different  We need to take a few minutes and  address the “why” after that person has spoken  Dont be one of those  people who already has an answer in their head before someone has  given their thoughts—not even listening to what they have to say  Those  inoneearandouttheother  people  arent  building  relationships  Theyre just frustrating others around them  “Eric I  understand what youre saying but that expense is not something that  we can commit to  We have two large events this quarter and the soft  serve ice cream machine doesnt fit into our budget ”  HUMAN CONNECTION  In my first company I had a lot of autonomy  As long as my sales  numbers were high I didnt have to get ideas approved first  Then  when I switched companies my new boss wanted to go in one  direction and I wanted to go in another  I chose my direction and  thought that if I was successful I could change his mind  Although it  was the right direction it was the wrong approach  I didnt do what he  wanted at all and assumed that the higher sales numbers would be  enough  He didnt change his mind and he almost fired me  I learned that if I disagree with my boss I cant just do what I  want to do and ignore him  If you disagree with your boss you should  make an argument for another approach  If they say no you can  discuss it one more time but then after that you have to drop it and  try it their way first  Try your best to make their idea work or they  will blame the failure on your poor execution  Your boss needs to see  their vision happen  If this way doesnt work its important not to say  “I told you so” or take the blame for their vision not working out  You  can now restate your case for a new approach moving forward  JAMIE LIBROT Director of Talent Management and Global Strengths  Leader  The “Just Because” Mindset  Although your opposition to someones idea may have made sense  at that time and place its OK to change your mind later  Listen openly  to new data and information presented and make a logical and factual  opinion as things change  Its not about losing or giving in its about  taking your ego out of it and making the best decisions for your  organization and team  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Its OK to say no  Whats not OK is being rude snarky or  inconsiderate of others and what theyre bringing to the table  Ultimately it all comes down to how you approach the situation  If  someone is sharing a new way that you dont agree with hear them  out anyway  Listen to what they have to say and then talk through it  Everyone deserves the opportunity to share their ideas and not be  blown off  In the long run this adds to a culture of free and open idea  sharing—because we really dont want people to be afraid to speak up  CHAPTER 12  Saying No and Setting Boundaries  INEVITABLY YOU WILL have moments when saying no to a  coworkers idea is the only real option for next steps  Maybe its just  not a plausible concept or plan or maybe you just dont have the  capacity in your workload to help see it to fruition  For these reasons and more you may find yourself in a potentially  awkward situation  But earning a reputation for being a naysayer or  an “I just dont have time for this” colleague hair toss and sigh  optional is not a reputation you should desire  On the flip side trying  to be a hero and taking on more work than you can handle isnt a good  idea either—for you or your company  Early on in your career its important to establish yourself as  someone who completes work and is a gogetter  This is also the case  when youre new to a company or team and want to prove your worth  But there are going to be times when you cannot say yes—times when  you logistically cannot take on more work and if you did the quality  of the other work and your personal life would be diminished  So  how do you say no without coming across as a bad team player  disgruntled or like someone whos just looking to get out of work  HUMAN CONNECTION  I had been working in the International Programs office of a small  college for several years  When the Dean of Students DOS announced  his departure the assistant dean ADOS took on his role on an interim  basis  The ADOS whom I did not report to had been handling  international student visas and she did not have the capacity to  continue once she took on the interim duties  I volunteered to help  and for two years I managed my previous workload in addition to this  large responsibility and other adhoc assignments without any raise  added budget or additional support  When we hired a new DOS the interim person went back to being  ADOS while I maintained the responsibility of international student  visas  She wanted me to keep it so that she could focus on other areas  At the same time the Associate Dean of Faculty ADOF was  promoted to Dean of Faculty DOF and became my new boss  The  newly appointed DOF had me take on parts of his old role which were  beyond the scope of my normal duties and had a learning curve  At  this time I now had my original responsibilities the international  student visas and several new responsibilities from my boss  I asked  my boss for additional personnel support so that I could continue to  perform this work and the new projects he assigned to me  However  due to the lack of budget my request was declined  Although it was hard for me I knew I had to speak with the ADOS  about taking back the responsibility of the student visas  I could not  continue to perform the responsibilities assigned to me under my job  function while also focusing on a critical function in the student visa  process  I knew if I kept it on my plate my other work would suffer  and I didnt want to cause potential issues with the student visas  Ultimately the ADOS took back the responsibility allowing me to  focus on my other tasks  Although I feared the professional impact of  telling someone I could not handle the additional workload I knew  the end result would benefit my department and my personal well  being  ANONYMOUS  Dont Say Yes When You Really Mean  No  There have been so many times when my mind is saying no but  my mouth blurts out yes to a colleague  Its just my natural reaction  when someone asks me to do something whether I want to do to it or  not  It can happen because I feel bad saying no or because I dont  want to disappoint them  But if you mean no its important to not say  yes  You dont want to get the reputation for committing to something  and not following through  And you dont want to take something on  when you know that your mental and physical health will suffer as a  result  If youre not ready to take the full trip into No Town provide  alternative solutions to help your coworker complete their project by  suggesting  Qualified individuals who may be able to assist  “I am working on a  few timesensitive assignments right now but Jen would be a great  person to ask as she is working on something very similar ”  An alternative timeline where you may be able to get involved if your  schedule clears up  “Ill be conducting two outoftown trainings over  the next three weeks  If this portion of the project can wait until I get  back I can help then ” “I need to finish this assignment by 1 p m  today but I can circle back to you at 2 ”  With that said dont just try to be nice by saying youll help later  if you know that you wont be able to  Things come up and we cant  predict the future but dont just prolong your no by delaying with  empty yeses  In the long run its much easier to be honest than to keep  putting someone off when your answer was always going to be no  “I  will be out of the office conducting trainings over the next three  weeks  I know there is a lot at stake with this project and I cannot give  it my full commitment and you deserve nothing less than that  May I  suggest reaching out to Tom in accounting as he has had experience  with this before ”  Finding Your GoTo Phrases  When your boss comes to you with another project at the eleventh  hour and youre already swamped with another deadline you cant just  say “No I dont feel like it” or “No Youre driving me nuts  Why do  you always wait until the last minute” Saying no to a supervisor can  be difficult because you dont want to come across as someone who  isnt hardworking or willing to go the extra mile for your team  You  want to be perceived as someone who can be counted on and who is  an asset to the company  But there are going to be times when taking on another project or  joining an additional committee is just not feasible given your current  workload  Having some phrases in your back pocket will help make  this no easier when your boss puts you on the spot  • “Thank you for thinking of me for this project but I am currently  working on the Griffin assignment that is due to our client by Friday  morning at 9 a m  Is this new project a bigger priority If so I can ask  Laurie to help me with these two assignments to ensure they get done  on time ”  • “That sounds like an interesting project but if I take it on I will not be  able to complete the Watershed assignment by the deadline  Which one  is more pressing and needs immediate attention and which one can  hold out for another week”  • “I know this project is really important and you need extra hands but I  am currently overextended with Project Cornucopia  Is there a specific  part that you especially need assistance with I dont think it would be  wise of me to commit to working on the entire project until this other  assignment is complete next Friday ”  This type of phrasing allows your supervisor to take charge and  decide what should be prioritized  In this conversation they might ask  you to stop one assignment to begin another  Before you do that you  want to make sure youre both on the same page  Supervisor “Tracy I need you to shift gears and put a hold on the  Star assignment and start working on the Moon project ”  You “I only have one more day worth of work for the Star  assignment  Do you still want me to immediately start working on the  Moon project”  Supervisor “Yes the Moon project is our top priority and should  only take two to three days  After youre finished please go back to  complete the Star assignment ”  You “Thank you for clarifying  I will immediately start on the  new project ”  What if the ask is coming from a peer from within or outside of  your department Although they might not be pulling rank for their  request its still important to show respect  Here are some no phrases  to try out for those situations  • “I appreciate being invited to join your new committee but I am  overextended at the moment ”  • “Im working on a few timesensitive projects right now but you may  want to reach out to Charles as hes mentioned wanting to get more  experience in this area ”  • “Thank you for thinking of me But I think Cherie would be more  suited for this assignment  She has been working on a very similar  project with another client and has received positive feedback  I would  be happy to connect the two of you and schedule a meeting if that  would be helpful ”  • “Thank you again for thinking of me however this is not an area in  which I will be able to assist you as my interests lie in other areas ”  • “That sounds like a lot of fun but I have a prior commitment and will  be unable to make it ”  • “Thank you for the invitation but I have a previous family  commitment and will not be able to attend ”  Being clear concise and direct allows you to specifically share  what youre working on right now and why you cant take on  something new  Remember these components when saying no  COMPONENTS OF SAYING NO  •  Show appreciation for being asked  •  Provide an explanation of why taking this on would be difficult  •  Ask for support in establishing priorities if appropriate  •  Use proactive and direct language  Although the focus of this chapter is on saying no I think its also  good to have some goto phrases and tactics ready for when youre the  asker  If youre finding yourself in a position where a coworker or  supervisor isnt using the components just discussed and they leave  you wondering why they turned you down you can take initiative by  Being prepared  If youre asking people to add something to their  plate understand whats already on it  What big projects do they have  lined up When is their busy time Do they have scheduled time of  already on their calendar Understand your starting point so you know  what areas to bring up during your initial or followup asks  Trying again another time  Maybe they were in a bad mood or felt  overwhelmed in the moment  Circle back for your ask when their  schedule is a bit clearer or theyve had their morning caffeine  Just  make sure youre not being pushy or seem to be waiting outside their  office every time they come back from a meeting  It really might have  been a no regardless of their caffeine intake  Asking for an explanation  This isnt about accusing or blaming  them for not taking on your ask  Its about understanding why and  making alternative plans if you get a flatout no without explanation  “Thank you for getting back to me  I am trying to put together a high  quality team for this difficult project and your name was on top of my  list  Can you elaborate as to why you will not be joining If its a  matter of timing I may be able to move some things around so it  better aligns with your other responsibilities ” However be mindful  that your line of questioning isnt to make the person feel bad about  saying no or to talk them into saying yes but to get a better sense of  the other factors at play  Requesting recommendations of people and resources  If theyve made  it clear that theyre either not interested or dont have the capacity—  ask for other options  “I appreciate your honesty  Can you recommend  someone else for the committee that you believe has the capacity  interest and knowledge to take this on”  Not taking it personally  A professional no is not personal  Its about  someones ability to take on something else based on their workload  or otherwise and not about how much they do or dont like you  “I  appreciate your honesty and I hope we have the opportunity to work  on a similar project in the future ”  STRATEGIES FOR FOLLOWING UP WHEN  SOMEONE SAYS NO  •  Be prepared to explain what youre asking them to do  •  Try again another time  •  Ask for an explanation  •  Request recommendations of people and resources  •  Dont take it personally  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  If you cant take on another project because you feel like youre  going to lose it respectfully turn it down  Be honest about where you  are what support you need and be sure to give a respectful response  It can be hard to say no especially when you want to help your  coworkers and impress your boss  But for the sake of your work  quality and your sanity sometimes you have to make a humble pass  Part V  The Power of Relationship Building  CHAPTER 13  Being Present Being Accessible  ACCESSIBILITY ISNT JUST being there physically  We have to be  mentally and emotionally open—in an authentic way that doesnt  immediately set off someones BS meter  One of the biggest complaints  I hear from my corporate clients is that they lack access to leadership  People can easily feel that there is a wall between them and us and  become further and further removed from the vision and mission of  the organization  When we dont get some type of face time with the  people at the top its hard to feel connected to what were working so  hard for  Being present and accessible can be hard  As a manager it can  feel like a burden to get out from behind your screen when meeting  requests are never ending and email notifications wont stop dinging  But if we dont make an active effort to acknowledge the people who  make up the organization they will start to look for other jobs with  companies where they feel seen and heard  One of the biggest barriers that perpetuates the feeling of them  and us is of our own making  We get so caught up in the day to day  that we dont always see the people who keep our company above  water  We dont give them the chance to ask questions be listened to  and feel valued  Being accessible and present even for 30 minutes a  week is a great place to start  And it is especially powerful for leaders  Every member of the organization should know who the senior  leadership is a little bit about them and more than just what their  faces look like from the company website  The human connections we  make helps shift our mentality from “work is a place I need to be” to  “work is a place where I want to be ” OK so work will never be as  desirable as an island vacation but you get the gist  Feeling connected  to the those we work with and for makes us feel connected to our  work—and thats a positive daily force  Now if youre envisioning a montage of kissing babies and giving  everyone a handshake or fist bump—thats not what Im talking about  Im simply talking about being more present and reachable  Not just to  the people who sit in on the board meetings but to the people who  make the daily grind happen  In one of my previous roles the senior leader made it a point to  go on an annual office tour  Everyone lined up in the hallway as she  walked around she shook everyones hand and then we took a group  photo  Ill admit this wasnt the type of interaction I was looking for  It  felt like a weird surfacelevel interaction that was done just for show  There was no conversation just a bunch of people in an awkward  weddingstyle receiving line  Dont be that kind of leader  Dont let those BS meters flare up  when you enter a room  Be both physically and emotionally present  for the people who work with and for you  Dont just check off a box  Actually care to engage  Serve Lunch Not Speeches  In one of my previous roles one of our executives made it a point  to schedule a luncheon once a month with 25 members of the  organization  An email was sent around and anyone could sign up  through an online form  The executives assistant chose at least one  representative per department and if you werent chosen that month  you had the opportunity to sign up for the following month  The goal  was to have anyone who wanted to meet him to have the opportunity  to do so  Were talking entrylevel through executive all levels and all  departments  And this wasnt your typical lunch where you just sat  there ate and then left  This was a roundtable conversation  The  buffetstyle catered lunch was set out we grabbed our food and then  we grabbed a seat at a circular table  The executive host sat at the table next to his fellow members of  the organization and with a full view of each staff member who was  present  He introduced himself in a nonelevatorpitch way and gave  us each the opportunity to give an introduction  He talked about what  he liked to do for fun his kids what drew him to the organization  and what he was excited about in the upcoming month  Then it was an  open floor for anyone to ask questions  Topics ranged from  improvements needed in the building to his favorite place to grab  coffee  Not only was this an opportunity to get some face time and ask  questions that we normally wouldnt get to ask but we also were able  to meet people from all over the organization  This informal setting  helped us build more trust with an executive member and air anything  we wanted to be heard  No question was turned away nor did we feel  judged and the free lunch wasnt a bad perk either  Livestreaming Leadership  Although it may be feasible for some to block out an hour a  month for something like an executive luncheon it might not be as  convenient for others  Likewise your organization may not have the  space for it or the budget  Another method might be to do a video  series with different members of the executive team the people we  tend to see less than anyone else in the organization  Im not talking  about a full feature film here just a short video two to ten minutes  that gives people a better understanding of who they are working with  and for  This isnt a sales pitch  Its just about communicating a real  message in an accessible format  Prior to filming the video send an email with a survey giving staf  the opportunity to ask questions for a senior leader to answer  Providing staff with a brief bio of the leader beforehand and the  responsibilities of that individual will enhance the quality and depth  of questions  If you have the technical capabilities stream the  interview live and then host it on an internal network for all to view  later  If you dont shoot it on a smartphone and distribute however is  easiest—no need to get fancy  The key is to actually get to know the  people who run the company not just see their name and headshot  You can even take this one step further—depending on the  information discussed and in what format—and share the QA on  your company website  This can also help bridge the gap between  prospective and current clients bringing them in on the experiences  within the organization  A logo or a slogan doesnt build trust but a  person an interaction or an experience will  HUMAN CONNECTION  In my former company there was a requirement to have a career  development discussion with each of your direct reports along with  the performance evaluation process twice per year  There was an  additional option referred to as a skiplevel meeting where you could  choose to meet with the direct reports of your direct reports for an  individual career development discussion  My personal practice as a senior executive was to actively  schedule skiplevel meetings with as many staff on my team as  possible  This was an infrequent opportunity for them to get to know a  senior leader and realize that everyone at all levels of the organization  is just another human being  It was not unusual for me to have over  150 of these onehour conversations in a given year as I would also  schedule them with our global employees when I traveled to their  offices  They were an opportunity for each of us the staff member and  I to learn more about each other personally and professionally  Although the discussion centered on the staffs education career  experiences and future aspirations we also spent time on personal  interests  These conversations helped the senior leadership team develop  networking opportunities for staff and recommend ways they could  improve job performance and position themselves for future success  But most importantly it developed individual connections so we could  have a comfortable discussion if we met in the hallway or at lunch  It  provided me with information about who might be ready for future  projects or challenging assignments  It also helped me develop  ongoing relationships so I could continue to mentor individuals as they  moved throughout the organization and enhanced their career  ANONYMOUS Senior Financial Executive in the Financial Industry  Establish an Accessibility Protocol  In several of my jobs my bosses were not consistently available  They were either constantly traveling or in and out of meetings  For  the most part this didnt impact the daily function of my job but it  did make it difficult when I had questions or was learning something  new  During such times I quickly became frustrated and felt  unsupported  I didnt know when I was going to be able to have my  questions addressed and I didnt want to leave my clients hanging with  no answers  Now when I work with clients I suggest having an initial  conversation where both the supervisor and the employee sit down at  least quarterly to identify what accessibility means to them and how  best to communicate with one another  This is where you have a  conversation about  The best way to communicate with one another when you have  questions  For urgent questions should we email text or call If a non  emergency question arises how can we get in touch with one another  and what is the expected response time  An emergency action plan for issues that need to be addressed  immediately  Discuss potential scenarios that may occur or have  occurred within your roles and triage how you will get in touch with  one another to find a solution  During a time when someone is  inaccessible who will be the alternative point of contact  Having an initial meeting to discuss this gets everything out in the  open about the accessibility of the supervisor and the expectations of  the employee so that everyone is on the same page  Open Office Hours  Days and even weeks can go by in which we dont see the people  we work with and for—even if theyre in the office next to us  When  we keep our heads down looking at our screens and we run around  from meeting to meeting it can be hard to get facetoface time with  our managers or employees  One of my favorite gotos to help solve  this issue is having open office hours  If youre physically located in an office with your employees set  aside a time period for example Mondays from 9 to 10 a m  when  your door will be open and anyone can walk in with a question  If  youre in a virtual space take this time to be online on your  organizations designated sharing and videoconferencing platform  Communicate your open office hours to your staff so they know  that they have access to you during that time  If youre on vacation or  have a meeting outside the office let your staff know that you have  rescheduled your hours to another day and if need be to the  following week  When you set aside a specific time it eases concerns  when youre not available because your team knows that at least once  a week they can get face time with you to ask a question or review  material  Heres the deal though its one thing to say “we have an open  door policy” and another to actually have one  Just because you leave  your door open doesnt mean people feel welcome to walk through it  Lets say Suzanne walks up to your office—door wide open—but you  remain head down completely engrossed in your work  When she  approaches you continue to read your email and dont look all of the  way up  What do you think Suzanne will do Well she has a few  options she can walk in and take a seat stand in the doorway until  you notice her knock on the door cough loudly until you hear her or  walk away  If you havent established a comeinandtakeaseat kind  of culture Suzanne is most likely not going to feel comfortable  interrupting your midemail gaze  In such a situation a simple hand gesture waving them in or  looking up for a second to say “Come on in and have a seat I just  need to finish this one thing” acknowledges their presence and gives  them the headsup that it might take a minute until they can have our  undivided attention  When we have the door open and have a policy  for people to come in but when they take us up on this and then we  immediately ignore their presence or worse shoo them away theyre  most likely not going to come back  And this means we miss a critical  opportunity to develop a strong communicative relationship with our  employee  If youre working through a project that needs your undivided  attention shut the door put a “do not disturb” notification on your  office messaging system and block off your calendar  You can even  reach out to your administrative assistant and give them the headsup  that what youre working on might take an hour and youll be fully  tied up during that time  If you dont have an administrative assistant  or havent talked to your supervisor about whether or not shutting the  door is OK start the conversation  “Mathew I have a few big projects  Im working on and want to give them my undivided attention for the  next few hours  Are you OK with me shutting my door so I can focus”  Sometimes we forget to shut the door and thats OK too Just say  to Suzanne “I want to make sure I can dedicate to our conversation  fully can I circle back to you in 30 minutes” Then actually go back to  Suzannes office in 30 minutes  If you need to set a timer or a  reminder on your calendar so you dont forget  Dont make a promise  of accessibility and not deliver  Walk the Halls  Get out of your office and walk down the hall and check in with  your staff at least once a week  Not in a hovering micromanaging  way but in a “Hi I know I have been tied up and wanted to see what I  can do to support you” kind of way  If youre not sure how to start the  conversation look for context clues in their workspaces  This could be  pictures of their kids dogs or a funny sign sitting on their desk  “Henry your dogs are adorable  How old are they” “Garrett that  looks like a fun family vacation where did you go”  Employees tend to go to their supervisors office but it doesnt  always happen the other way around  And it should Show your face  around the office and say hello to the people who work with and for  you  Hit the Lunchroom  This goes for anyone in the organization including leadership  Instead of eating at your desk sit in the common area with your team  and dont talk about work  No one always wants their boss watching  over them but if youre up for having a conversation about the latest  TV shows the new restaurant in town or a book you loved—most  people would be in  Just be yourself and let people get to know you  outside of your work persona  They will feel more comfortable when  they need to ask questions because theyll see you as more  approachable  Celebrating What Matters  Im one of those people whos a sucker for birthdays  You know  the one who will decorate your desk buy you a birthday coffee and  put a card in your mailbox  I get equally invested when someone has  earned a promotion is having a rough day or when they went out of  their way to do something nice for me  Taking the time to  acknowledge someone during their special or even frustrating event    whether its big or small means something  It shows youre paying  attention and that you care  To avoid the “oops I forgot your birthday” moments make a note  on your calendar and set it as a reoccurring event so you remember  Set a reminder on your calendar for events in the future that an  employee mentioned are important to them  If someone mentions their  favorite coffee or candy during a random conversation write it down  so you wont forget to add it to their holiday or “just because” gift  You can create a spreadsheet add it to your meeting notes or put it in  the notes section of your phone  Do whatever helps you remember  these little details that mean so much to them  HUMAN CONNECTION  As a manager and business owner its important to be invested in  what you do  I still get excited when I secure a client on a TV news  show and it fuels me to work harder  I try and use this excitement to  influence my employees to also secure press for our PR clients  I want  them to actually see why the passion is so important  Being genuine and having heart goes a long way  Dont just tell  your employees you care actually show them by celebrating with  them  Whether its through a financial incentive by cheering them on  or by taking them out to celebrate a big win let them know that  youre committed to their success  If your team believes in you and  your mission they will work harder to ensure they make your  company a success  JEN SHERLOCK President of Jenna Communications  These small acts of kindness make you more accessible both  physically as youre handing someone something or telling them how  awesome they are and emotionally  You show that youre listening to  what matters to them and that you care about their personal and  professional success  Inaccessible OverCommunicate It  Communication can build trust and make employees comfortable  It shows that were putting ourselves out there and that were  providing information that we believe is valuable to someone else  When we dont communicate it can leave people around us confused  lost and feeling underappreciated  One of the most overlooked pieces of information that we can  forget to communicate is when were taking vacation and sick days  As  an employee you most likely need to request time off from your  supervisor either through an internal system or through a documented  conversation  If youre a supervisor and dont report to someone  directly its still essential to have that exchange  Youre not asking or    requesting permission but youre letting your team know that you  wont be available for the day and if anything goes off the rails who  they should contact  Someone from your staff should always be  available to reach out to in urgent situations  Without this people tend  to panic  I will never forget the first time I was sick in one of my roles  I  was working at a college at the time and I got slammed with the flu  and could barely make it out of bed let alone to work  I had never  called out before never asked how to do it or who I should call to do  so  Should I call my supervisor The front desk My colleagues I had  meetings scheduled with Or someone else Since I didnt have access  to student information on my personal computer I chose my  supervisor and left a voicemail and sent an email  Well my supervisor  was in meetings all morning and didnt have the chance to check her  messages until lunch  As a result my morning student appointments  showed up because they hadnt heard otherwise  They were  disappointed to find out that I was out for the day and confused as to  why no one had let them know  I was frustrated by the way I handled  situation  Not only had I not asked about the correct protocol ahead of  time but I didnt confirm that someone else in the office had gotten  my message  So who should I have called My answer now everyone Learn  from my fluinduced blunder and make sure you discuss the best way  to communicate that you will be out sick before youre actually sick  Is  it via email text or a phone call With one simple email where you  copy all the appropriate parties you can let everyone know that you  will be out sick that day  If you take it one step further you can cancel the meetings you  had on the calendar so it automatically sends those individuals an  additional notification  Dont leave people hanging and thinking youre  accessible when you arent  Communicate and then communicate  again that youre out sick and wont be available that day  In one of my other previous roles I once walked down the hall to  ask my supervisor a question and was told by a neighboring officemate  that he wasnt coming in that day  He had said goodbye to her on the  way out the day before with a “See you Thursday”       on a Monday  My coworker was thrown off and asked for clarification  Our  supervisor said that he forgot to add a professional development  conference to his schedule and would be out the next few days  Not  only was that frustrating because my question had to go unanswered  but we also had a meeting with him on the books for that day  A  meeting that was still on the calendar and had not been cancelled  This lack of accessibility in the immediate moment was  frustrating but the lack of respect he showed by not letting our team    know of his absence put a strain on his relationship with us  This  situation is not unique this happens all the time  We get busy and  forget what we communicated and what we may have left out  After the incident I initiated a conversation with our group on  how to communicate our days off  We decided that we would block of  our individual calendars let the front desk know and tell our team  and anyone involved in our projects in advance of planned time off  An outofoffice message would be placed on our voicemail email and  internal messaging system  It would be 100 percent clear from all  angles  If we were out of the office for work and would be in a different  time zone we shared the time difference between our new location  and the central office in our outofoffice correspondence  This made it  easier for both internal and external stakeholders to not only reach us  but also to understand why it might take us a little longer to respond  If you dont have a handy email or voicemail ready try these  OutofOffice Email Templates  Thank you for your email  I am currently traveling to our Brussels  office six hours ahead

immediate assistance please call name at phone number  As a manager you also want to notify the person youre leaving in  charge during your absence to let them know that they are in fact in  charge  Ive unknowingly been the point person for other managers  who were on vacation and it can be extremely confusing when youre  trying to triage incoming calls and emails without the headsup  Again when it comes to stuff like this too much communication is  way better than too little  Always make sure everyone is in the know    Make an Accessibility Plan  With employees working in various time zones with clients from  all over the world its important to have an accessibility plan in place  If your physical office closes at 5 p m  but your team works alternative  hours someone should be available for employee questions during  that time  Employees should never feel that they are on their own  island because of their work schedule  If you as their manager arent available during those times  appoint a project or team lead who can field questions  If youre an  employee and this issue has come up talk with your supervisor about  what can help you do your job better  “Greg even though were on the  East Coast most of my clients are on the West Coast and some have  emergency issues after our Philadelphia office is closed  Who is my  direct contact for afterhours emergency issues I want to make sure  Im serving the needs of the client and addressing issues as soon as  possible  For nonemergency situations I will let the clients know that  we will get back to them by the end of the following business day ”  HUMAN CONNECTION  I travel a lot for business and am often in the car or on a plane  but this does not mean that work stops  It just means that I must have  systems in place without bogging anyone down  Predictable and  consistent questions can usually be sent via email while I opt for a  quick huddle or a phone call to explain tasks that require collaboration  and more soft skills  If I am not available I delegate a point person  who knows my style of handling these situations  Our team also uses  emails and Google Docs to keep track of details and updates  Because of how many moving pieces my calendar contains its  best that my Business Development manager Rebecca keeps control  She knows who I need to be seeing and who I dont  She also knows  how to prioritize opportunities for me and the team  I also have one or  two people who ensure that I see and complete timely tasks by the  deadline  Do we make mistakes now and then Sure  But more so than  not this way of working keeps us moving faster and everyone is  happier than the alternative  Empower those you work with to make the decisions that need to  be made so that you dont become the bottleneck to your business  My  team is highly effective and productive because the majority of the  decisions made can be made by them  WINNIE SUN Managing Director and Founding Partner at SunGroup  Wealth Partners  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Were all human and can forget to communicate when were    heading on vacation or taking a sick day  Who feels like emailing  from under the covers But without taking the extra step to let people  know whats going on youre on the path to losing trust from your  team  When you dont make yourself available to answer questions and  show and share that youre there to support your employees and  coworkers your relationships suffer  The result is confusion  frustration and often high turnover  People dont stay at  organizations when they dont feel valued and heard—especially by  their direct supervisor and team  A misstep every once in a while is  one thing but a pattern of avoiding clear communication is another  Communicate  Be present  Be accessible    CHAPTER 14  Going Beyond the Small Talk  IN EVERY JOB Ive had Ive always made it a point to get to know  my coworkers  I thrive on being in an environment in which I feel  connected to the people around me  This may be because I like most  Americans typically spend more time at work than at home or with  family and friends  Im always sure to secure a work best friend you  know a WBFF who I can talk to when my day sucks and who  mutually appreciates my constant need for a sugar fix  Interestingly  enough Gallup data shows that women who strongly agree that they  have a best friend at work are more than twice as likely to be engaged  in their work than women who say otherwise  In addition all  employees with WBFFs are 27 percent more likely to say that their  opinions seem to count at work 1  In translation When you work with people you know like and  trust youre more productive and feel more valued in the organization  But finding that person or group of people can be tricky  Its not only  about stepping out of your comfort zone but also about creating a  space for these professional friendships to form  Building relationships takes time  Like in the rest of your life you  cant develop a true friend overnight  Even if youre not seeking a full  out friendship these personal connections build comradery and  improve your working relationships  They show that youre interested  in what someone else has to say and you never know what you might  have in common  At one job after just a few minutes of conversations with my new  peers I found out a coworker and I went to the same high school  another coworker and I had children born a week apart and a third  coworker loved something workrelated that I hated and was willing  to train me on it spreadsheets—the part of the job I was dreading  most  By opening doors for conversation you never know what youll  learn  And you can opt to be personal or more reserved based on your  own personality  Personally I err on the side of fullout friendships  At my last job  my WBFFs were my life  I really dont know what I would have done  without them  They would keep me sane when things got crazy had a  constant supply of Swedish Fish at the ready and put me in my place    when I needed to be put there  They were the first to tell me if I acted  out of line at a meeting or was getting worked up over something that  just wasnt a big deal  Without them I would have felt lost unheard  and undervalued in certain situations  We were always there for each  other for the good the bad and the reality check  Although having a WBFF isnt for everyone most people work  best when they have some type of relationship with their coworkers  Its important to feel safe secure and valued in the workplace  especially since we know that its possible were spending more time in  the office than at home  When we find these people we are even more  loyal to the organization as a byproduct of being loyal to the people  who work for it  Get Out of Those Comfort Zones  Building relationships makes a difference whether youre a  supervisor a project lead or an individual contributor  The problem is        its hard  Sure it may be simple to strike up some small talk but  chances are when we do so well just find out when its supposed to  rain this weekend  We dont get to know the people who work with  and for us this way  “How about this weather” will never get us out  of the officespeak clouds and into strong grounded relationships  At times you are going to have to put yourself out there and get  uncomfortable  Your instinct may be to avoid people when you see  them in the hallway or to come into work 10 minutes earlier to avoid  those parking lot hellos  But there are tangible benefits both  professionally and personally to making the effort and putting  yourself out there  You can start with some baby steps  Try out these conversation  starters next time youre walking down the hall or heating up your  lunch in the break room  Future plans  “What are you up to this weekend” “Do you have  anything special planned over the holiday break”  Celebratory or life event  “I just saw on the calendar that its your  birthday on Saturday  Happy Birthday What are you planning to do to  celebrate” “Congratulations on your new home  Are you starting to  feel settled in”  Mutual connection  “When I was on Facebook last night I noticed  that we both know Rob Smith  What a small world How do you know  him” “Ive been meaning to tell you that Mary Snyder says hi  Shes  my new neighbor and mentioned that she graduated high school with  you ”  Common interest  “Did you see who the Phillies traded last night  How do you think thats going to affect their starting lineup” “I saw    the picture of your new puppy on your desk and shes adorable  Were  thinking about getting a German Shepard too  Do you have any  suggestions on where to look or what to look for”  Work question  “Im working on this spreadsheet for Karla and I  cant seem to figure out how to input this formula  I think you use it a  lot in your work right Can you walk me through it” “I was so  impressed by your presentation yesterday  Are there other resources  you would suggest if I wanted to do more research on the topic”  Compliment  “The macaroni and cheese you made for last weeks  pot luck was awesome  Ive tried to make it before but it doesnt turn  out as tasty  Whats your secret” “You did such an awesome job  planning our team retreat  The location food and topics were perfect  Where did you find the speaker”  After youve started the conversation its important to ask follow  up questions based on their answers so it doesnt dissolve into  meaningless small talk  Show that youre listening and interested in  getting to know them better  “Thats a great place to have your  birthday dinner  I was there a few months ago for a friends birthday  and the cake was amazing  Who are you going with”  CONVERSATION STARTERS  •  Ask about future plans  •  Congratulate them on an accomplishment  •  Ask about a mutual connection  •  Share a common interest  •  Ask a work question  •  Give a sincere compliment  Keep It Casual  After you start a conversation its a good idea to keep it going  Find a good time that works for both of you to continue where you left  off  Change the scenery so its an even playing field and not in a formal  office setting  A common option is a coffee shop but sometimes cafes  can be jam packed or loud or just not the right fit  Try taking a short  walk outside for some fresh air  Or explore a new building—or even  just a different floor or area of the building youre in—together  The  content of the conversation may be the same but the location a little  different  Getting moving can help get those conversations going  So you may walk and chat and strike up a nice exchange  Or you  may think “Whoa this is a little awkward ” And thats OK If youre  struggling to connect try these questions to take your conversation to  the next level     IM CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR  CAREER  TELL ME ABOUT THE FUN STUFF  • What was your first job and  what did you learn from it  • What surprised you the most  about this job and our  company  • What was the best career  advice youve received and  how did that change your  perspective  • What professional  organizations have you  received value from  • What professional development  opportunities have enhanced  your career  • How do you find balance  between your career and  personal life  • What skills are vital to your  role and are valued by the  organization  • What good books have you read  lately Im looking for some easy  reads for my weekend at the  beach  • Do you listen to podcasts Are  there any that you would  recommend for my car ride to  work  • Where is the last place you  traveled and who did you go  with  • Do you have a travel bucket list  What is at the top of the list  • Have you always lived in this  area If so how has it changed  over the years If not where did  you live before  • What apps or technology could  you not live without and why  • What were you like in high  school  • Who would play you in a movie  Keep it light and ask questions that will start to reveal who your  coworkers are outside of their job roles  But remember dont go too  deep too fast and be mindful of things people may not want to talk  about with a coworker  “Where was your vacation this summer” is  safe  “Do you want to have children some day” may not be  We all  have different feelings on what is fun to talk about and what is in the  “umm please dont ask me about that” category  So keep it baseline  to start Travel hobbies pop culture  And start to get a sense of how  deep to go from there  HUMAN CONNECTION  To make a personal connection its important to be authentic and  show sincere interest  As the Director of the Society of Professional  Women SPW I put together several programs a year with high  profile individuals  When I am going to reach out to an author or  speaker I try to read at least half of their book or watch a few of their  videos to be able to point out parts that resonated with me changed    my perspective or helped me with something  I also share the benefits  and rewards of their participation whether that includes monetary  contributions making further connections or enhancing their  portfolio  As I start working with them I like to add personal touches  If  they mention a favorite restaurant or favorite color I incorporate it  into my appreciation notes or event details  I try to remember  important facts if they open up about their children or personal  milestones  If they have a book being released I set a reminder to  reach out  The care you take in the details means a lot  People are  much more willing to work with you if you show that you actually  care about what they have produced and put some thought into  reaching out and keeping the connection  NICOLE STEPHENSON Director Society of Professional Women  Leading and Connecting by Example  If youre in a position of leadership you can use your powers for  good  There are many ways to not only provide a space for people to  build relationships but also to model the behavior youre looking for  Relationshipbuilding initiatives create comradery within your  organization help employees feel valued and take your group to the  next level by understanding each other more fully  Try out some of  these strategies to get the informal conversations started within your  team  Spend a day on a local cause  Many companies are moving toward  paid time off for volunteer work where youre given the opportunity  to take a day and spend it with a cause of your choice  Youre paid  your daily rate and dont have to use a sick or vacation day  Ask your  employees to come up with a few local causes that are meaningful to  them and use your volunteer days together  If your organization  doesnt have such a program see if there is an opportunity to set one  up  Whether youre doing a clothing drive planting flowers at a local  park or tutoring kids at a local school ask others to join you in giving  back  Form a team to tackle something close to your heart and use it  as an opportunity to connect your team  You can also team up with  other local businesses to make an even bigger impact  HUMAN CONNECTION  My dad and I have owned our custom frame shop for the past 20  years and our involvement in the community goes back over 40 with  an active role in the Colonial Neighborhood Council CNC food drive  One day when I was bringing in clothes to donate I noticed how low  every shelf was on food  There was only one can of tomato soup and  very few other nonperishable items  I decided to put a donation box at    my shop and called on a few other small shops to do the same  We all  let our existing customers know that food supplies were low and asked  if they wanted to donate  There were times when Id pull up to CNC  start unloading and families would shop out of the stuff I was  bringing in the door  In our firstyear volunteering for CNC we  collected almost 7000 pounds of food over a twoandahalfmonth  period  This amount has grown every year since and this year we  brought in almost 40000 pounds of food  Although every cause needs  all the help it can get I think the established help comes from people  and companies who believe or who want to be there which is not  part of their job description  People want to connect and help other  people  Even the people being helped want to help someone else in  another way  If you can find something you are passionate about and  find a way to help someone else  BRIAN COLL Owner of Colls Custom Framing  Unforced happy hours  No employee wants to feel like theyre being  held hostage at work after hours  No matter how much I love a good  glass of wine it tastes obligatory and uncomfortable if my boss is  telling me I have to drink it at 500 p m  on a Friday at work  Instead  of extending the work day think about dismissing an hour early  instead  Head to the bar open a conference room or congregate  around that ping pong table thats collecting dust  Schedule your  happy hour during work hours and your employees will feel grateful  If it runs later and people want to stay mission accomplished  Let the hall conversations happen  In some workplaces people are  discouraged from talking in the hall or judged for not doing their  work  I get it Ive been there  Its frustrating when the same people  seem to be talking all of the time and it looks like theyre not able to  figure out where their office is  But you would be surprised at how a  quick “What are you working on” can turn into “I can help you with  that” This small talk isnt wasting time  It helps build connections that  can enhance teamwork and ultimately productivity  Its an outlet and  an opportunity to talk informally with colleagues and supervisors  With that said if you see employees hanging by the water cooler or  having conversations in the hall that are starting to interrupt work  bring it up with those specific individuals  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  People innately seek human connection and that doesnt exclude  the hours from nine to five  You dont need to be best friends with  your coworkers but you should be       well       human  Take a minute  to thank someone for their work share some treats or take a walk  Do  some small things together that can take you beyond the small talk  and toward real meaningful connections    CHAPTER 15  Building a Culture of Trust  “JUST TRUST ME ” When was the last time you heard that and  honestly felt comfortable Trust is not something that you can just ask  for its something that you need to earn  More importantly its very  easy to lose  People form an ability to trust us based on their  interpretations of our actions and not necessarily on our intentions  We need to give our employees supervisors and coworkers a reason  to trust us by making a positive impact—through our actions and not  just our intentions  A few years ago I was having severe sinus issues and went to a  physician  My experience with the physician involved him shining a  light in my nose for about five minutes followed by a hurried  instruction to schedule a surgery for several months out as he  practically pushed me out of the door  In that five minutes of faceto  face time with the doctor I didnt feel we had built a relationship  where I wanted to trust him for this procedure  Although he was the  expert in the room and a person of authority he still needed to earn  my trust  I opted to get a second opinion and went with a new  physician to perform the surgery because she spent time answering my  questions and took an interest in how I was feeling  This example of doctorpatient trust can be applied to our  workplaces  Just because you have a certain title or position doesnt  mean that people trust you  Earning it takes time action and proven  ability  HUMAN CONNECTION  Im a big proponent of modeling the behaviors that you want to  see in those you lead  My goal is to build teams that are diverse to  ensure that we can leverage the different perspectives when working  toward an objective  My highestperforming teams have typically  included very diverse talent backgrounds age gender race culture  and their diversity was not hidden but rather brought forward as an  asset  I recall one team that I inherited after a conflict they ran into with  a former manager  This group wasnt cohesively working together due  to lack of trust and varying personalities  When I took the role I  decided not to dwell on the issues that led to their former manager    leaving the company but instead build a group that could rally around  a common purpose  By using our skills and knowledge we were able  to produce highquality deliverables and work together more closely  It was a difficult challenge but in the end the group knew I respected  them and they were able to become a cohesive team  Its been over 15  years and Ive had many teams since but to this day I am still in  contact with several members of that team and consider them to be  some of the best talent that Ive worked with  C  COFFEY VP of a Large Insurance Company  What Is Trust  Before we jump into how we can earn trust lets talk about what  it is  According to Stephen Covey in his book The Speed of Trust its  made up two components character and competence  Covey says  “Character includes your integrity your motive your intent with  people  Competence includes your capabilities your skills your  results your track record ”1 Without both of these areas youll have a  difficult time building and earning trust  People need to know that  youre not only genuine and motivated by good but that you also have  the knowledge and skill to be talking about or doing whatever it is  thats on your agenda  And just because youve earned trust doesnt  mean its sealed and there to stay  We have to make an active effort to  retain the trust of the people who work with and for us  Lets start with  how to show youre competent  HUMAN CONNECTION  I started a new job as the head of an underperforming department  that didnt know it was considered dysfunctional by most of the  organization  I was hired to “fix” it and quickly discovered I needed to  restructure and lay off two of the seven employees  After the two  people were let go I sat down with the remaining staff and explained  my reasons for the change and the reality of a new structure  expectations and responsibilities  Although telling them I had let go of  their colleagues was hard I wanted to be as transparent as possible  I  left them as a group to process and told them Id be in my office and  would stay as late as necessary to answer their questions one on one  That afternoon and evening each person came in to talk to me and I  walked them through my decision and how their job was going to  change  Any question was fair game and I didnt dismiss any concern  I wanted the team to know I would support them with professional  development and that if something wasnt working we would talk it  out and find the right path together  Although some people were on board quickly which was an  amazing gift there was one woman who was completely freaked out    about the change  She didnt trust me why should she and I could  tell a lot was going on under a seemingly calm surface  About a month  after the reorganization during which time I was constantly affirming  their work and allowing input into their new roles she came into my  office and just stood there looking at me  She blurted out “Im really  worried that you are going to hire a new person and then get rid of me  like you did the other two people ” This was a huge deal for her and  frankly an equally huge relief for me  It showed that I had started to  build some level of trust for her to speak so honestly  She ended up  being a powerhouse of a colleague who got promoted and it all  started with that slow building of trust  CELIA C  Know Your Stuff  Whether youre a supervisor or an employee in a nonleadership  role its important to know what youre talking about  “Fake it until  you make it” wont work here and it will actually just make the  situation worse  If you want to be trusted with information and  important assignments its essential to stay current with whats going  on in your field and to extend your quality of work  Some of the more  obvious gotos are attending conferences or taking a course but with  our busy lives these are not always an option  A few smaller things  that can be folded into our routines include  Setting up Google alerts for your industry on trending topics  Youll  get an email every night that pulls together articles for you instead of  spending time looking for outofdate information  Listening to a podcast on your commute to work  Ask your colleagues  and peers for suggestions or check out the top 100 podcasts noted  within your listening platform  Taking an online mini course  Platforms like LinkedIn have short  courses taught by experts in the field  Theyre usually no more than  one hour and are made up of many short videos three to ten minutes  to either watch during your lunch break in between meetings or on  your train ride home  If you stay informed in one or more of these ways when someone  asks for your input you can answer intelligently with relevant  information that can be used to make informed decisions  Youll be  seen as someone who not only cares about their work but also as a  trusted and valuable resource  Although its important to stay sharp in your field and contribute  your insight to your team dont be a knowitall  Be humble in your  delivery  Weave your expertise into your work and discussions but  dont be the guy thats like “Well I just read a 500page book on how    to build more strategic teams  From my expert perspective were not  utilizing the strengths of our team effectively in your plan  We need to  scrap what youve been working on and start again ”  Give What You Have  Authentic relationships provide value       and value leads to trust  During a meeting or conversation try to be forthcoming by sharing  your expertise knowledge and experience  “I was just reviewing those  statements and I added a formula in one of the cells  It calculates the  percentages automatically so we dont have to go back and forth  between spreadsheets  I would be happy to pull up the spreadsheet  now and show you if that would be helpful for the other sheets youre  working on ”  This isnt to show off but to give someone else information when  they either ask directly for it or appear to be struggling and you can  help  Dont be pushy or step into situations where youre not invited  For example if two people are having a private conversation its not  the time to use your eavesdropping skills to try to be the hero  You  dont know the backstory and butting in can come across as invasion  of privacy no matter how sincere your intentions are  If they move the  conversation into the open kitchen area and ask for your input thats a  different story  Once people get to know you and see that youre  approachable and that you want to give advice for the authentic sake  of being helpful trust can begin to build  Assign or Ask For a Meaningful  Project  If youre in a position to do so give employees the opportunity to  make a difference within the organization by assigning them  meaningful projects  Not an “order the team lunch” kind of task but  something that lets them show off their skills while pushing the  companys mission forward  If youre not a supervisor ask your boss  for a chance to try something new to further show that you can be  trusted to complete great things  There are endless possibilities of  areas to work on but here are a few to get you thinking  • Does the website need to be revamped  • Are you looking to take the companys social media to the next level  • Are you launching a product and trying to target a new demographic  • Is there an innovative way to streamline a process    • Are you hosting a companywide diversity training and looking for  new speakers and venues  • Does the organization have affinity or resource groups you could get  involved in  If youre a supervisor providing an opportunity make sure youre  transparent and share  • Professional benefits of taking on the assignment  • Why you chose them  • Deadline and criteria  • Expression of appreciation during the process  • Explicit trust in them to complete this assignment  “Keene were looking to enhance our companys online presence  and I know you have experience in this area from your side hustle  What youve done is incredible and I am confident that you can  increase engagement on our platforms  Were looking to increase our  primary platform followers by 10 percent next month  Social media is  starting to play a larger role in our department and I want to ensure  were working together to build on your skills and set you up for a  promotion in the next few months  Is this something you would be  interested in having a more detailed conversation about”  Share with your supervisor your past experience in this area your  plan for this assignment and why you would be the right one for the  job  “Ive been working on a social media campaign for my side hustle  and have increased engagement by 45 percent in two months  I know  social media is something were really trying to grow and I know I can  do a great job with it  I would start sharing more relevant content  engage with likeminded individuals to increase our reach and take  additional photos for our platforms ”  “Yes and      ”  When youre in a meeting show others that you not only heard  their contribution but also that you want to work together and build  on their idea by using “yes and        ” This can be a fun way to  brainstorm and build trust because now your teammates know youre  listening and appreciate their contributions  It also shows that you  have experience and insight in this area and are looking to partner up  to make their idea happen  Be sure to not fully take over their idea as  it might seem like youre trying to take credit when in fact you want  to find ways to work together  Ben “I think we should have our July retreat at the new outdoor    center down the street ”  Christina “Yes and we could bring in Claire to lead us on the  ropes course ”  Ben “That sounds great  And we can have it catered by the Italian  restaurant next door ”  Christina “Awesome idea  And I can call Samantha to see what  other activities she did when she took her team there a few weeks  ago ”  Youll see that “yes and      ” can come in its literal verbatim  form  Or it takes on some samemeaning synonyms “Great idea And      ” “I love that  And      ” “That sounds great And      ”  Be Present  Just because were in the same physical space as someone else  doesnt mean were present  With so many distractions it seems like  its easy to be texting answering emails holding a conversation and  buying a new pair of shoes all at the same time  But people know  when youre not 100 percent there  Small things like making  consistent eye contact make a big impact  Dont think about what  youre going to eat for lunch or all of the things on your todo list  focus on the current conversation  During meetings make it a point to  turn off notifications and leave your phone in your pocket or purse  Once the phone comes out even if it is face down it can give the  impression that your attention is elsewhere  Unless youre using them  to take notes putting devices out of sight is the way to go  Being present also means being a part of the conversation and  sharing a little about yourself  Even if you know the person youre  meeting with already theres always something new you can share  Onesided conversations dont enhance relationships and we have to  give a little in order for someone to feel comfortable opening up  This  isnt about overtaking the conversation and giving your life story or  being the “one upper” who always has an experience thats bigger and  better its just about being relatable and open to sharing your own  experiences  • Were you just as nervous as they are when you started this job  • Did you try something new and it also didnt work out  • Did you also just move into town and are looking for the best Chinese  food  When youre having these conversations listen to the other person  and build your questions and stories off of what theyre talking about  Its obvious when youre not paying attention when you share an    unrelated story or ask questions on information they already covered  Take a deep breath be yourself authentically listen and share your  common interests and experiences  Balance Your Asks with Offers  Be vulnerable ask for help and let your employees and  supervisors know that you care about their success and the quality of  their work  Your being guarded often leads other people to be  guarded  When you put yourself out there and ask “checkin”  questions you show that youre human and genuinely invested in what  youre working on  Try out these questions during your upcoming  conversations  “How can I support you in your role” and “What can I do that would  be helpful to you” These are great questions to ask your supervisor and  colleagues when youre just starting out in the job or on a project or  when you notice that someone is struggling and could use your help  It  shows that you want to meet them where they are and identify their  best interest  “What might be missing or have been overlooked” After youve  created the plan but before you get too far into the project  This gets  everyone on the same page and allows for adjustments to ensure  youre meeting expectations  It also shows that you want to ensure the  success of the project and want to leave no stone unturned  “Do you have the capacity to do this” Before assigning additional  work ask your employees if they have room in their schedule for it  Discuss their current workloads and upcoming projects and let them  be honest with you about whether or not taking on this additional  responsibility is possible  When you ask this question its important to  listen and respect their response  If they cant take it on triage with  them on alternatives including alternative people timelines or  redistribution of work  “What fires have you had to put out this dayweekmonthquarter”  This not only gives you an opportunity to understand some of the  challenges and barriers your employees are facing but it also gives  you the chance to do something about it  If you can understand these  obstacles you can provide better support and resources to help them  “What do you need from me to make this successful” Ask what you  can do to help your employees or teammates complete this work  They  might need additional support people or material resources  Asking  the question shows that youre invested in them and the overall  project  In general questions that start with who what where when and  why give someone else the opportunity to tell you their story describe    how theyre feeling and ask for the support they need  When we dont  ask openended questions we can get yes or no answers that dont  help us build trust a relationship or a connection  HUMAN CONNECTION  As a result of a permanent visual impairment in my left eye from  an episode of optic neuritis brought on by my multiple sclerosis I  needed to have a very daunting conversation with my supervisor  about accommodations  I was mostly blind at the time and was not  sure if this would be temporary or if I would eventually be able to see  shapes hard lines or colors  I was afraid that my team or my boss  would lose trust in my skills as a marketing director to design and edit  copy  In my conversation I asserted the fact that they deserve the  utmost quality of my work and in order to provide it I would need  additional monitors to adjust document sizing to leverage a greater  attention to detail  I followed up my request with material that suggested this  impairment was actually a superpower  Highlighting this perceived  limitation as a strength warranted respect versus pity and admiration  versus uncertainty  I was fortunate to eventually regain my vision and  was better able to acknowledge and appreciate every detail with more  meaning and clarity  By being open to the conversation and accommodations my  supervisor showed their willingness to be flexible and I felt  appreciated  Everyone thrives in different environments whether it is  the result of a hidden illness or otherwise  Some professionals favor  quiet solitude others prefer loud music and being surrounded by  visual and creative inspiration  When employees know they are  appreciated theyll reciprocate by helping break down barriers  My  supervisor took the time to acknowledge my needs provided me with  the support I required and instilled confidence in my team and in me  to be successful in our roles  CHANTEL SOUMIS Founder and Creative Director Stardust Creative LLC  Micromanaging What a Buzzkill  The best way to kill creativity and trust is by micromanaging  Avoid sending excessive emails peering over someones desk or  showing up every day at 3 p m  to “just say hi ” This can be perceived  as a lack of trust for your employees ability to complete their work  I  know it can be hard because at the end of the day youre responsible  for making sure your team is following through but you need to give  your employees the space they need to show what theyre capable of  Dont crowd them  You should however be transparent about your  needs deadlines and the importance of the project  Without    transparency they wont know when things are due what youre  looking for in the task and how essential it is to the organization  Let  your employees know that youre going to give them the space to  complete the tasks but that they should reach out to you for questions  or if they get stuck  Make yourself available without looking over their  shoulder  “I want to give you the flexibility and freedom to complete  the project in the way you think is best  But know that I am here to  support you if you have any questions or need additional resources  along the way  My door is always open ”  Although the manager is the one that makes the rules employees  can and should make suggestions to enhance the relationship  People  complain about their boss and act like theyre powerless to the  situation  Which yes sometimes they are but often the employee  needs to take some ownership in the relationship as well  They need to  take on some tough conversations on their own accord  Writing it off  as the bosss job to know what theyre thinking or feeling just isnt a  fair approach and wont lead to positive change  When you approach your boss to ask for adjustments it is key  that you do so respectfully recognizing the hierarchy in your  relationship  If your manager is micromanaging try having a  conversation by starting with “In order for me to be most productive  I need one full uninterrupted business day to work through this  project ” Or “Do you mind if I close my door or go into a private work  space so I can focus on this project without interruption” Ultimately  your supervisor wants you to get your work done well  Theyll  understand they need to give you the space freedom and flexibility to  be more productive  Saying Sorry—The Right Way  When you work with different personalities you may discover  that youve lost someones trust  But that doesnt mean youll never get  their trust back  When you lose someones trust its essential that you  get out of your own way identify why it was lost be humble and  sincerely apologize  In a study titled An Exploration of the Structure of  Effective Apologies Dr  Roy Lewicki found there were six components  to an apology and the more of these components you add the more  likely it is for your apology to be accepted 2 Its not just saying “Im  sorry” and then moving on  These components are the start to  rebuilding trust  APOLOGY  COMPONENT  SAMPLE STATEMENT  Expression of regret  “I am genuinely sorry for making that offensive  statement ”    Explanation of what  went wrong  “I inaccurately used the phrase and did not realize  its implications ”  Acknowledgment of  responsibility  “I accept full responsibility for my actions ”  Declaration  of  repentance  “I not only regret making this statement but have  learned that this is not appropriate and will not use  it in the future ”  Offer of repair  “I registered for a cultural sensitivity training next  week because I want to ensure I am more educated  on this subject  If you have any additional  suggestions please let me know ”  Request  for  forgiveness  “Please forgive me for my actions ”  Based on these six steps lets go over some key things to avoid  when delivering your apology  Insincere apologies  If youre going to give an insincere apology  you might as well not give one at all  If youre rolling your eyes and  using a patronizing tone the other person can spot it from a mile  away  Insincere apologies just make the situation worse  If you need  to take some time to process everything before you take ownership  and apologize  Its not about what you intend to say its about what  you say and how it makes someone feel  Your tone says it all here are  some examples of what not to do  image “Yeah Im sorry about that ” said with a side eye and a  snarky tone  image “Im sorrrrry ” said with a long drawn out accusatory  sorry  image “Like I said Im sorry ” said in an argumentative and  accusatory tone  Defending your actions  Defending or making excuses doesnt make  the other person feel any better  Focus on the other individual not  you  And leave the “coulda” “shoulda” “woulda” out of it  Avoid  statements like “Had you finished the project earlier I could have  answered the email on time  So really mistakes were made on both  sides ”  Using indifferent statements  These statements turn the conversation  in a different direction potentially accusing someone else  image “Brooke Im sorry I offended you but Ive been having a  really rough week ” This brings the conversation back to you and is  making an excuse for your actions  Try instead “Brooke I apologize  for my offensive actions ”  image “Cole Im sorry if I upset you ” Not only is this not taking  ownership for offensive actions it also implies that Coles feelings    might not be warranted  Try “Cole Im sorry that I upset you ” Simply  changing “if” to “that” provides an absolute statement of apology  image “Tate Im sorry you feel that way ” This is not accepting  responsibility while it also implies that Tates feelings might not be  genuine  Try “Tate I apologize for my comments that made you feel  that way ” Similar to the previous suggestions the adjustment of the  language acknowledges the other persons feelings and takes  responsibility for your actions  Although there is no guarantee that using these six components  and avoiding these problem areas will rebuild trust its a start  When  trust is lost it takes time and continuous effort to make progress in  gaining it back  Continuing to have open conversations with your team  and individual employees about what they need from you is an  ongoing process  All situations and personalities are different and  keep in mind that every solution wont work equally for each person  or situation  HUMAN CONNECTION  I used all my sick and personal days off for child illness and then I  had to take another day to be home with my sick son  I went to my  supervisor and asked if I could work on a Saturday to make up some of  my time  My boss identified a specific project I could work on and  went to the director to pitch the idea  My supervisor then took the time to lay out exactly what I would  be doing during that time for the director and why working on the  weekend would be beneficial to our company  It meant so much that  she went to bat for me  She not only earned my trust but my sincere  respect  As a result I know that my supervisor and overall company  have my best interests in mind which keeps me motivated to be a top  performer  BRIANA LORA Biotech  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  No one is perfect  At some point or another well unintentionally  offend a coworker or take an action that could break their trust in us  The difference between the trusted and the untrusted is that trusted  people step up apologize and take ownership  Trust is hard enough to  gain and once its lost its even harder to earn back  Take the time to  build rapport and relationships with others by being present giving  insight and allowing people the opportunity to shine  Trust is not  about showing off what we can do  Its about providing spaces for  others to show what theyre capable of while being willing to learn  along the way    CHAPTER 16  Communicating Change and  Embracing It  WE TALKED ABOUT how to open the lines of communication and  build relationships with people in your workforce who think act and  experience life differently than you  But we cant move around a few  chairs or add more video conferencing to the mix and expect  immediate change and support  Change is hard  Its even harder if  people dont feel like theyre part of the process  In this chapter were not going to cover the actual change youve  chosen to make based on what youve read and how to specifically  implement it within your unique and specialized organization  This  chapter is all about communicating change  Well cover  • How to get buyin from members of your organization and what buy  in really looks like  • What to consider if youre an employee affected by change  At the end of the day it all comes down to including the right  people at the right time with the necessary information  As a leader  or future leader one of the key things to acknowledge and ask  yourself is this “Were making a change that affects our company and  employees  How do we get everyone on board to make it successful”  Even if youre not in a leadership role you should be thinking “What  value can I add to successfully help facilitate this change” Change is  good but selling change can be tough  We need leaders and onthe  ground advocates to make it happen  Communicating Change as a Leader  To start answering this question as a leader and begin creating a  plan of action you need to ensure that your initiatives consider  employees at all levels from general staff to senior leadership  One of  the reasons change may fail is that people are afraid of what they dont  know  When you start knocking down physical walls or even making  more minor changes without communicating why people can question    your motives start making assumptions and spread rumors  You also  cannot assume that everyone will have the same perspective on the  change so you need to be proactive in your communication and get  ahead of any chitter chatter  This involves not only being transparent  but making an active effort to get people on board before you shake  things up and flip the “normal” upside down  HUMAN CONNECTION  During one of the busiest times of year one of my colleagues was  suddenly let go  Although it may be common in other organizations  this was a rare occurrence for my department  I had worked with this  colleague to streamline and improve several processes to better  support our office and clients  They provided a high level of support to  not only me but also to our entire department  Their skills in data  entry pulling reports and institutional knowledge on processes were  critical to our daily operations  At the time they were let go we were starting an annual large  scale project that required a high level of support  Management did  not  communicate  how  we  would  be  redistributing  their  responsibilities  Fellow members of our team assumed a few of us  would absorb my colleagues tasks to complete the project  Frustrations were high as we had to figure out ways to pull  reports or access the information required to complete the project  Suddenly what took our colleague a few minutes was now taking us  hours  It was not until I approached my supervisor that they began to  identify how this change would affect our departments workflow  It  was still unclear as to how I was to complete my tasks without the  necessary support or information  Many of the frustrations we experienced as a result of our  colleague being terminated could have been avoided  If there had been  a conversation prior to their departure about their responsibilities to  make sure everything was documented it would have alleviated the  confusion over how to proceed with daily functions  We also would  have benefited from our leadership being proactive and creating a  clearly communicated plan instead of the ad hoc approach that  resulted in the team feeling resentful and overwhelmed  Had there  been more support and transparent communication from the  leadership we would have been more resilient as an organization and  better able to recover from losing a valuable member of our team  ANONYMOUS  Get to Know Your Employees  This is an ongoing process and shouldnt just happen when change  is expected  As a leader you should always be working to figure out    what gets your employees excited what motivates them and what  tends to make them nervous  We cant assume that our reactions  thoughts and feelings are the same as theirs  In fact you should  assume theyll be different to make sure you get a better understanding  of everyones varied personalities  We all respond to change differently  and knowing how to individualize your conversations will not only  create a smoother and sustainable change but more importantly it  will foster authentic relationships  Reflect back on previous chapters where we discuss employee  strengths generational communication preferences and motivations  accessibility and ways to earn and retain trust  These strategies and  insights will help you engage in better oneonone conversations with  your employees  Explain Your “Why”  When were having conversations about things that scare us our  selective hearing mechanisms tend to kick in  So when youre leading  a conversation about change its so important to have a clear and  consistent message and clearly defined expectations  When having  conversations with your team members make connections on how the  new processes spaces or whatever else will enhance the success of  their individual work your teams performance and the overall  organization  For example if youre adding a virtual team meeting  once a week be transparent with your staff and let them know why its  being added how long youll meet and what you will be talking  about  Explain the why  Specifically share how adding these meetings  will enhance the team and their work  The goal is to empower your  employees with a clearly thoughtout message that does not leave  them making assumptions and questioning your motivations  When I started in one of my positions in higher education I was  given an office  About four months into the role a colleague and I  received an email that said we would both be moving from our offices  into cubicles in the back of the main reception area and that the other  three advisors would remain in their office space  The email was very  vague and just asked us to pack up our stuff by the end of the week as  our new spaces would be ready by then  We were both confused as to why only the two of us were being  asked to move into this space and of course we started making  assumptions  We began to think we were on our way to being fired  and that our supervisor wanted to take a closer look at our  performance  Needless to say we had no idea what was going on and  were nervous about this new situation  After we moved to our new  spaces we still hadnt gotten an explanation and we tried to make the    best out of the circumstance  A few months later we received another  email telling us to pack up our stuff and move back into our old  offices  After my thensupervisor moved on to another role a faculty  member explained the situation they had been thinking about  converting our two offices into a new classroom but the plan did not  work out  Although we were relieved to finally hear what had  happened my colleague and I had spent those few months concerned  about our performance and too nervous to say anything for fear of  being let go  Our supervisor did not communicate why this large  change was happening nor did they ask us for our input to gain a  better perspective  Had our supervisor communicated in person as to  why we needed to move our spaces it is likely that my colleague and I  would have felt more confident about or least understood the need  for the change  Mediums for Intentional Messaging  About Change  How we share information about impending changes can be just  as important as what we share  If youre making a larger change like  moving work spaces a single email is not going to cut it  This message  is something that needs to be addressed in a variety of ways likely  including emails town halls and small group meetings  If youre  upgrading to more comfortable chairs in the huddle room a simple  email giving employees the heads up is sufficient  The messaging and choice of medium is your chance to ease  concerns answer questions and highlight the importance of the  change  Identify the level of change youre making and determine the  appropriate mediums with which to disseminate this message  Review your audience and scale of change to make sure your  communication tools best fit the situation to ensure everyone is  receiving your message  HUMAN CONNECTION  One of the hardest parts of being the head of talent management  is letting people go  In a former job I was responsible for  implementing a confusing and controversial seniorlevel process called  Top Grading  We had a new CEO and he wanted to clean house  because of financial losses and previous poor performance  All seniorlevel leaders were to go through an assessment process  APlayers would remain BPlayers could possibly remain but anyone  evaluated as a CPlayer an average performer would be terminated  Outside consultants created the process and made most of the    decisions  I was tasked with the overall communication and  implementation details for the company  It was not even a process I  endorsed  I used my network of corporate HR leaders to provide information  to the business units  I went on the adage that its nearly impossible to  overcommunicate dramatic change so I used various ways of  delivering a muchneeded definition throughout the company  This  included emails meetings oneonone conversation and workshops  all to keep employees informed  Even though this was a hard time for everyone involved my  communication strategies created more transparency for the affected  employees  It was important to create clear and consistent messages  with such a large change  BARBARA TAYLOR Partner of JanBara  Associates  Updates Less Is Not More  Depending on what youre changing you might need to make  adjustments along the way  Its important to find a consistent method  for sharing new information so you dont spring these changes on the  stakeholders  When my old office was getting rid of the file room and  expanding the kitchen area our operations team would consistently  send us email updates on the progress  These standard emails always  had the same branding across the top and used the subject line  “Kitchen Expansion ” This subject signaled to readers that this was  important information on the renovation while keeping it consistent  It  made it easier for us to stay in touch with the progress and for the  email to not get lost in the clutter  Heres another example  Lets say your employees were expecting  to have their new workspaces ready in March and that the furniture is  on backorder until May  It may sound obvious but let them know  Dont fear the repercussions of something you cant control wait until  March has come and gone and then give them the information youve  been sitting on or not sitting on because youre still without chairs  Go for honesty over unwanted surprises every time  Being proactive with updates can lead to problemsolving  opportunities with your staff and offer a chance to adjust the original  plan  You can share updates through an internally shared document  through a weekly email in individual facetoface conversations in  town halls and by discussing them during staff meetings  The success  of your change can benefit from consistently updating people with  information along the way  Recruit Change Ambassadors    Although you may need buyin from the top for change to be  successful you also need support on the ground  Finding the  influencers within your organization who can help communicate the  change and be its cheerleaders can help take it to the next level  Look  for people who others trust  Do others believe in their ideas Do they  produce positive results These employees can also be a resource to  help you identify your communication medium clarify and promote  your messaging and navigate politics in various departments  Reflecting back on the strengths chapter chapter 1 look into the  employees that youve identified as influencers  These are the people  who can motivate others and get them excited about whats to come  They put others at ease and can help sell your idea  Talk It Out  Once you get buyin it doesnt mean its guaranteed to stick  around  Creating spaces for discussions about the change asking for  feedback and then acting on the feedback ensures continued support  Its important to follow through and not ignore the dialogue because  in doing so youll leave your staff feeling less empowered and more  frustrated that you asked and did nothing about it  If someone has  spent time to actively participate reciprocate by acknowledging and  acting on it  Or even if you decide not to take action acknowledge  that you heard the suggestion and explain why youre going to take a  different direction  Equip Them for the Change  Yes change can be difficult no matter how big or small it is  When we shake things up it can be hard to gain support from people  who are intimately familiar and comfortable with how things are  currently working  But why make it more difficult than it needs to be  In order to make change happen its essential to remove barriers and  provide resources for people to be successful  If youre adding a virtual  team meeting and a few members need headsets or a better  functioning camera make it happen  If youre encouraging more  inclusive dialogue among your diverse team members—like diversity  discussion or new meeting formats—provide oneonone coaching and  expert trainings to ensure everyone is properly equipped for these new  conversations  The more you can ease the stakeholders into this  change the more receptive theyll be to make the adjustment  Model Change Behavior  Lets not forget that if leaders dont model the change you wish to    implement it will be hard to gain support and get traction  Its like  when I eat handfuls of Swedish Fish in front of my kids and tell them  they cant have it because its not healthy  Im telling them one thing  and showing them another behavior  Although employees are not your  children leaders in an organization have a responsibility to  demonstrate the behavior they wish to see  Middle managers can  monitor daily behaviors proactively spot any issues or concerns and  promptly address them  Senior leaders can also reinforce model and  embrace the change while supporting their middle managers in their  roles  EXAMPLES  OF  CHANGE  COMMUNICATION SUGGESTIONS  New coffee machine  in  kitchen  small  change  • Send an email and place instructions by the  coffee maker  • Ensure at least one person understands how to  use the new product in case there are questions  • Note this persons contact information on the  email and written instructions  New  process  for  submitting  reimbursementstravel  medium change  • Send an email and discuss during relevant group  meetings prior to the change  • Email and conversations should include  information on upcoming trainings on the new  platform contact person for questions and date  of launch  • Once launched send out an additional email  with training information and contact person if  they have questions  If possible include short  videos to walk staff through how to use this  platform for viewing at their convenience  • Keep track of frequently asked questions and  send another email one to two months after the  launch detailing the answers to these questions  both in text and video walkthroughs    Moving from closed  offices to open floor  plan large change  • Consistent and ongoing communication  throughout the process is crucial  • Recruit change ambassadors who can help spread  the message  Equip them with frequently asked  questions you expect to answer specific details  about the move and contact information if they  or the people theyre speaking to should have  questions  • Host town halls and small group meetings to  explain the change have employees view the  rendering of the new layout provide contact  information to help answer questions and  introduce the change ambassadors  They can also  help triage these meetings  • Keep all employees updated throughout the  process by hosting additional small group  meetings and sending email updates with a  consistent subject line and branding  Emails can  also include links to videos of leadership walking  through how the new structure will physically  look and how you intend to use the space to help  employees visualize the progress and understand  how it impacts them  • Change ambassadors can host opendoor  meetings for employees to air their individual  concerns  These concerns are then looked into by  the appropriate parties and the change  ambassadors communicate back the resolution to  the employee  • Create videos and signs to be placed on new  spaces and equipment and send emails that  address best practices for use of new spaces right  before the space is complete  • Once complete ensure leadership is modeling  best practices of the new space and host a ribbon  cutting ceremony  This will not only celebrate  the launch of the new space but also is a forum  to share contact information for anyone who may  have questions in addition it shows that your  organization is invested in the success of the new  layout    TIPS FOR COMMUNICATING AND IMPLEMENTING  CHANGE  •  Get to know your employees to better cater your communication  •  Explain why the change is necessary  •  Communicate and then communicate again  •  Find and use influencers to help support the change  •  Ask questions to understand potential hesitations  •  Remove barriers and provide support  •  Model the behavior youre trying to implement  Embracing Change as an Employee  Lets shift gears and talk about employees who are not in a  leadership role and are not in a position to make organizationwide  decisions  Even though youre not the one directly responsible for the  change you still have the power to make an impact and advocate for  yourself and your team  The key is to do it in a constructive way  HUMAN CONNECTION  Just because you have always used a blue pen doesnt mean a  black pen will be a problem switching to a black pen might not be  necessary but its not a problem  Change can provide an opportunity  to look hard at procedures and assess them more objectively  Can we  do this better Will this create a better result for our clients We tend  to get very comfortable doing things the way we do them and it can  be easy to forget that sometimes change even for no apparent reason  can be good  It provides more experience for us to draw on gives us  more options when were looking for solutions and enriches us as both  people and professionals  JUDY M  Ask OpenEnded Questions  Take some time and write down the questions you have right  now and anticipate having as this change rolls out  These questions  might include  • What is my role in this change  • Who is my contact to ask questions  • What resources will be available for our team in support of this  change    • What can I do to help ensure the success of this change  Identify the person to whom it would be best to direct these  questions  This might be your supervisor or someone in another  department who is more intimately involved in the process  This is not  a chance to interrogate argue or complain about the impending  change its an opportunity for an open dialogue to ease your worries  HUMAN CONNECTION  If you have questions about an organizational change and how it  will impact your role a facetoface meeting is best  This affords you  the opportunity to see someones body language and get a better  understanding through the tone of their voice  As youre setting up this meeting send an email as a primer to  provide clarity as to what you want to accomplish during the  conversation  This also sets up the other person for success  Try using  specific language “I would like to have a better understanding of the  staffing changes and how it impacts my role ” “I would like to have a  list of ideas for how to communicate this message to my team ” “I  would like to have an agreement on my role during the interim ” By  using these neutral phrases you have helped set the tone of the  conversation  and  showed  your  intention  to  gain  a  better  understanding of your role to help ensure the success of the change  ELEANOR LYONS Partner at Human Edge Resources LLC  Get on Board       Or At Least Try To  During your conversations its important to show support and  effort toward making this change successful  If this is something youre  excited about and believe in be an influencer to get others on board  and ask how you can help  If youre on the fence or dont understand  how this will impact you be proactive and ask questions and gain  clarification  You dont want to be the one making assumptions and  spreading rumors  Reflect on the tools in this book to gain confidence  in asking questions to ease your concerns  BE HUMAN  ACT HUMAN  Even the bestintended changes can leave our everpositive  optimists feeling skeptical  But if we keep telling ourselves its not  going to work and make no effort to try it wont  Try leaving some of  that skepticism at the door  We have the power to choose how well  react to change and then that change may have the power to make  things better  When someone starts complaining about new changes  its easy to continue the conversation and throw in some negative  comments  You need to decide whether to get on board with  something new or if youd rather just walk around being grumpy    Change is not easy  But being someone who cant see beyond their  comfort zone wont get you—or your organization—anywhere new  improved or better    HUMANIZING OUR WORKPLACE  PLEDGE  To put into action the concepts and strategies youve learned in  this book its important to make a commitment to yourself your team  and your organization as a whole  Nothing will change if were not  making an active effort or continuing the conversation  The following is a sample or startingoff point for your pledge and  commitment to bringing a more human element to the workplace  You  can create your own personal pledge or work with your team to find  verbiage that makes sense for your roles and organization  But just  taking the time to solidify your thoughts into strategic actions is the  start to creating real human change  IWe believe humanizing our workplace will enhance  collaboration innovation and problem solving  It will also increase  engagement empower our employees and help us stand out as a  peoplefirst organization  IWe commit to creating spaces to share promote and include  diverse perspectives backgrounds experiences and knowledge where  people feel heard and valued  IWe will inspire others by stepping out of our comfort zone to  meet people who think act and experience life differently from us  As advocates for humanizing our workplace Iwe will make a  conscious effort to support ongoing initiatives actively listen to others  ideas accept responsibility for our actions be open to change and  create spaces for inclusive dialogue  HUMANIZE OUR WORKPLACE PLEDGE  IWe believe humanizing our workplace will  IWe commit to  IWe will inspire others by  As advocates for humanizing our workplace Iwe will    NOTES  Introduction
